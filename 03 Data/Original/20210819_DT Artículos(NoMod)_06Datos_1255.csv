DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.  SETTING: Data from waves 1 to 5 of The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in  Europe. PARTICIPANTS: The total sample was 28 857 community-dwelling individuals  aged 50+ years. MAIN OUTCOME: All-cause mortality associated with COPD and HAT  adjusting for covariates. We performed Aalen additive hazards models to explore  these associations. Interactions between COPD and HAT were also explored. Analyses  were conducted separately in three birth cohorts (>1945, 1936-1945 and ≤1935).  Latent class growth analysis was used to classify participants into HAT. RESULTS:  Three parallel HAT were found in the three birth cohorts ('low', 'medium' and 'high'  healthy ageing). Participants with COPD had an increased mortality risk, but this  effect was no longer significant after adjusting for covariates. The 'low' HAT was  associated with increased mortality risk in the three subsamples, although this  effect was lower after adjustment. The interaction between COPD and HAT was  significant only in the ≤1935 birth cohort, indicating that those with COPD and a  'low' trajectory had a greater risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The healthy ageing  scale may be a suitable tool to identify patients at higher risk to mitigate disease  burden and improve patients' quality of life.","2021-07-28","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e050947","","7","11","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

As people age, and with diminishing physical and mental  capacity, they become increasingly dependent on external supports from others and  from their environment. In this paper we look at changes in housing across later  life, with a focus on the relationship between housing and women's care needs.  Methods: Data from 12,432 women in the 1921-26 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal  Study on Women's Health were used to examine the interaction between housing and  aged care service use across later life. Results: We found that there were no  differences in access to home and community care according to housing type, but  women living in an apartment and those in a retirement village/hostel were more  likely to have an aged care assessment and had a faster rate of admission to  institutional residential aged care than women living in a house. The odds of having  an aged care assessment were also higher if women were older at baseline, required  help with daily activities, reported a fall, were admitted to hospital in the last  12 months, had been diagnosed or treated for a stroke in the last 3 years, or had  multiple comorbidities. On average, women received few services in the 24 months  prior to admission to institutional residential aged care, indicating a potential  need to improve the reach of these services. Discussion: We find that coincident  with changes in functional capacities and abilities, women make changes to their  housing, sometimes moving from a house to an apartment, or to a village. For some,  increasing needs in later life are associated with the need to move from the  community into institutional residential aged care. However, before moving into  care, many women will use community services and these may in turn delay the need to  leave their homes and move to an institutional setting. We identify a need to  increase the use of community services to delay the admission to institutional  residential aged care.","2021","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","566960","","","9","","Front Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Byles, Princehorn, Forder and Rahman.","","","","","","PMID: 34222159  PMCID: PMC8249770","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Longitudinal Studies; *healthy ageing; *home and community care; *housing; *Housing; *longitudinal data; *residential aged care; *Retirement; Accidental Falls; Australia/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is  associated with adverse health outcomes, but has not been extensively studied for  the muscle disease sarcopenia. We aimed to determine the prevalence of probable  sarcopenia, a precursor to sarcopenia diagnosis, based on the European Working Group  on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) guidelines overall, and according to SEP.  METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 3342 community-dwelling older adults  [mean age (SD) 68.9 ± 6.3 years] from Wave 1 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on  Ageing. Probable sarcopenia was identified using gender-specific cut-off values for  handgrip strength as recommended by EWGSOP2. SEP was defined by educational  attainment. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to determine associations  between probable sarcopenia and pre-defined risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 23.4% of  the population had probable sarcopenia and was significantly higher in the subset  with low compared with high SEP (28.9% vs 18.1%, p<0.001). Consistent with this,  multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that disadvantaged SEP was a  significant determinant of probable sarcopenia [OR, CI 1.48 (1.17, 1.87) p<0.001].  Other known risk factors, namely, increased age, low physical activity, comorbidity,  and osteoarthritis were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of  probable sarcopenia, while overweight/obesity appeared to be protective. CONCLUSION:  Disadvantaged SEP was an independent determinant of probable sarcopenia in  community-dwelling older adults. These findings highlight that SEP and health  inequality should be considered in prevention and treatment policy for sarcopenia in  the community.","2021","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1119-1129","","","16","","Clin Interv Aging","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021 Swan et al.","","","","","","PMID: 34168435  PMCID: PMC8216634","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Prevalence; *Health Status Disparities; aging; hand grip strength; Hand Strength/physiology; Independent Living/*statistics & numerical data; muscle function; Muscle Strength/*physiology; Muscle, Skeletal/*physiology; Obesity/epidemiology; sarcopenia; Sarcopenia/diagnosis/*epidemiology; socioeconomic position","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the influence of SA and its changes on mental health such as depression remains a relatively unexplored area in gerontology. Therefore, we investigated the longitudinal association between changes in SA and depressive symptoms in Korean older adults.Methods: This study comprised a longitudinal sample of older adults aged ≥ 45 years, drawn from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2018). Changes in SA status was determined using the Rowe and Kahn model over two consecutive years. Using an adjusted generalized estimating equation model, we examined the association between changes in successful aging status, namely SA and NSA (Non-successful aging), and depressive symptoms.Results: Compared to the SA→SA group, depressive symptom risk in the NSA→NSA and SA→NSA groups were higher in men [(OR, 1.16; 95 % CI, 1.13-1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95 % CI, 1.08-1.13), respectively] and in women [(OR, 1.15; 95 % CI, 1.13-1.18), (OR, 1.11; 95 % CI, 1.09-1.14), respectively]. Subgroup analysis of the dimensions of successful aging revealed that low or worsening criteria of successful aging status in men and women were associated with depressive symptoms.Conclusions: Korean older adults who continuously failed to attain or maintain successful aging status had the highest risk of depressive symptoms. These results could further assist in establishing policies and interventions that promote successful aging and subsequently protect the mental health of the Korean older adult population.","2021-06-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:45:05","","352","","1","21","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34107866  PMCID: PMC8191095","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Prospective Studies; *Aging; *Depression/diagnosis/epidemiology; *depressive symptoms; *KLoSA; *longitudinal analysis; *older adults; *Successful aging; Republic of Korea/epidemiology; Depression -- Diagnosis; Depression -- Epidemiology; South Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to describe baseline distributions and transitions  over time between levels of dependency among older persons after being granted  social care in a Swedish municipality. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal cohort study  in a Swedish municipality, data was collected retrospectively from municipal  records. All persons 65 years or older who received their first decision on social  care during 2010 (n = 415) were categorized as being in mild, moderate, severe, or  total dependency, and were observed until the end of 2013. Baseline distributions  and transitions over time were described descriptively and analysed with survival  analysis, with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, over the entire follow-up period. To test  potential differences in relation to gender, we used the Cox-Proportional hazards  model. RESULTS: Baseline distributions between mild, moderate, severe, and total  dependency were 53, 16, 24, and 7.7%. During the first year, between 40 and 63%  remained at their initial level of dependency. Among those with mild and moderate  levels of dependency at baseline, a large proportion declined towards increasing  levels of dependency over time; around 40% had increased their dependency level 1  year from baseline and at the end of the follow-up, 75% had increased their  dependency level or died. CONCLUSIONS: Older people in Sweden being allocated home  help are at high risk for decline towards higher levels of dependency, especially  those at mild or moderate dependency levels at baseline. Taken together, it is  important that municipalities make use of existing knowledge so that they implement  cost-effective preventative interventions for older people at an early stage before  a decline toward increasing levels of dependency.","2021-06-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","342","","1","21","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34078277  PMCID: PMC8173751","","","","Aged; Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; *Disablement process; *Functional decline; *Health promotion; *Healthy ageing; *Prevention; *Reablement; *Social Support; Cities; Retrospective Studies; Sweden/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study determined the effects of dietary diversity score (DDS) and food consumption on healthy aging. A subset of the  data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey was utilized in this study. DDSs were  calculated using the dietary data collected in the years 2009 and 2011. A healthy  aging score (HAS) was calculated by summing the standardized scores on physical  functional limitation, comorbidity, cognitive function, and psychological stress  based on the data collected in the year 2015, with a lower HAS indicating a  healthier aging process. Life quality was self-reported in the year 2015. This study  found that DDS was inversely associated with HAS (T3 vs. T1: β -0.16, 95%CI -0.20 to  -0.11, p-trend <0.001). The consumption of meat and poultry, aquatic products, and  fruits was inversely associated with HAS, and participants in the highest tertile of  staple foods consumption had a higher HAS than those in the lowest tertile. HAS was  inversely associated with good self-reported life quality and positively associated  with bad life quality. In conclusion, food consumption may influence the aging  process, and adherence to a diverse diet is associated with a healthier aging  process in elderly people.","2021-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:42:30","","1787-1787","","6","13","","Nutrients","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34073820  PMCID: PMC8225052","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Aging; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Nutritional Status; Quality of Life; Feeding Behavior; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Multivariate Analysis; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Human; *Healthy Aging; *Diet; China; cognition; comorbidity; dietary diversity; Fruit; healthy aging; Meat; Nutrition Surveys; physical functional limitation; psychological stress; Self Report; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Healthy Aging; Comorbidity; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Food Intake; Logistic Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alongside increased physical frailty, anxiety symptoms associated with the  risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion appear to represent its most prominent 'sequelae'. The  attentional and linguistic resources required for decoding virus-related information  may also influence the perceived threat of contagion. However, the possible role of  neuropsychogeriatric factors on the latter dimension has never been assessed in a  longitudinal study on the older population. To fill this gap, 50 healthy cognitively  preserved older adults underwent a neuropsychological and physical frailty  assessment before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, they agreed to be interviewed and  re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2) through a  longitudinal one-year study. Perceived threat of SARS-CoV-2 at T2 was predicted both  by baseline anxiety and frailty scores, and by decreased performance in information  processing speed and language comprehension tests. While confirming the joint role  of frailty and anxiety, a moderation/interaction model showed that each of them was  sufficient, at its highest level, to support the maximum degree of perceived threat  of contagion. The contribution of neuropsychological factors to perceived threat of  SARS-CoV-2 highlights their importance of tailoring information campaigns addressed  to older people.","2021-05-29","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","11","18","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 34072431  PMCID: PMC8198099","","","","Aged; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; *Healthy Aging; *cognitive functions; *COVID-19; *mood deflections; *normal aging; *perceived threat; *phenotypic frailty model; Communicable Disease Control; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to examine the  association between tourism experiences and mortality in Chinese aged 65 or above.  METHODS: We included 9520 participants aged 65 years or above from the Chinese  Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey at baseline in 23 provinces in 2011. They were  followed up in 2014 and 2018. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess  the association between tourism experiences and the risk of death. RESULTS: Among  9520 participants, 7.85% had at least one tourism experience outside of their local  city/county during the past 2 years. During 35,994.26 person-years of follow-up, in  total 4635 deaths were observed. The crude rate of death was greater in participants  who had no tourism experience than in older travelers (incidence rate: 13.70 versus  5.24 per 100 person-years). Elderly travelers had a significantly lower risk for  all-cause mortality (crude hazard ratio: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.33-0.44) compared with  non-travelers. After adjustment for all covariates, the risk of all-cause mortality  was 27% lower among those with at least one tourism experience than among  non-travelers (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62-0.85). Subgroup analysis  showed that the associations between tourism and the decreased risk of mortality  were stable. CONCLUSIONS: Tourism decreases the risk of mortality in the Chinese  elderly.

Based on that Healthy Ageing concept  proposed by the WHO, the SoBeezy intervention has been designed through an older  person-centred and integrated approach. The programme creates the environments that  maximise functional ability to enable people to be and do what they value and to  stay at home in best possible conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Five levers are  targeted: tackling loneliness, restoring feeling of usefulness, finding solutions to  face material daily life difficulties, promoting social participation and combating  digital divide. Concretely, the SoBeezy programme relies on: (1) a digital  intelligent platform available on smartphone, tablet and computer, but also on a  voice assistant specifically developed for people with digital divide; (2) a large  solidarity network which potentially relies on everyone's engagement through a  participatory intergenerational approach, where the older persons themselves are not  only service receivers but also potential contributors; (3) an engagement of local  partners and stakeholders (citizens, associations, artisans and professionals).  Organised as a hub, the system connects all the resources of a territory and  provides to the older person the best solution to meet his demand. Through a mixed,  qualitative and quantitative (before/after analyses and compared to controls)  approach, the research programme will assess the impact and effectiveness on healthy  ageing, the technical usage, the mechanisms of the intervention and conditions of  transferability and scalability. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Inserm Ethics Committee  and the Comité Éthique et Scientifique pour les Recherches, les Études et les  Évaluations dans le domaine de la Santé approved this research and collected data  will be deposited with a suitable data archive.","2021-04-29","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e043082","","4","11","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Methods: Participants were recruited from the Healthy Aging and Biomarkers Cohort Study (HABCS), which conducted a baseline survey in 2008-2009 and follow-up of 3 times in 2011-2012, 2014, and 2017-2018, respectively. A total of 2 213 oldest old were enrolled in this study. The general demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and disease data of the oldest old were collected, and physical measurements were made for the oldest old. Fasting venous blood was collected for uric acid and blood glucose detection. Information on the incident and death of T2DM were collected through the follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to explore the association of hyperuricemia and plasma uric acid level with the incidence of T2DM. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) function was used to explore the dose-response relationship of plasma uric acid levels with the risk of T2DM. Results: The age of participants was (93.2±7.6) years old, and 66.7% of the participants (1 475) were female. The plasma uric acid level at baseline was (289.1±88.0)μmol/L, and the prevalence of hyperuricemia was 13.3% (294 cases). During 9 years of cumulative follow-up of 7 471 person-years (average of 3.38 years for each), 122 new cases of T2DM occurred and the incidence density was 1 632.98/105 person year. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that per 10μmol/L increase in plasma uric acid level, the risk of T2DM increased by 1.1% [HR (95%CI): 1.011 (1.004, 1.017)]. Compared with the participants with the lowest quintile of plasma uric acid (Q1), the risk of diabetes increased by 20.7 % among the oldest old with uric acid in the highest quintile (Q5) [HR (95%CI):1.207 (1.029, 1.416)]. The risk of T2DM was 19.2% higher in the hyperuricemia group than that in the oldest old with normal plasma uric acid [HR (95%CI): 1.192 (1.033, 1.377)].

It is unknown the immediate impact of social  restriction recommendations (i.e., lockdown, stay-at-home) on the life-space  mobility of older people. Objective: To investigate the immediate impact of COVID-19  pandemic on life-space mobility of community-dwelling Brazilian older adults and  examine the social determinants of health associated with change in life-space  mobility. Design: Baseline data from a prospective cohort study (REMOBILIZE Study).  Setting: Community. Subject: A convenience snowball sample of participants aged 60  and older (n = 1,482) living in 22 states in Brazil. Methods: We conducted an online  and phone survey using an adapted version of the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Linear  regression models were used to investigate social determinants of health on the  change in LSA score. Results: Regardless of their gender and social determinants of  health, participants showed a significant reduction in life-space mobility since  COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Life-space mobility reduction was higher among black  individuals, those living alone and aged between 70 and 79. Other variables  associated with change in life-space mobility, to a lesser extent, were sex,  education and income. Conclusion: Social restriction measures due to pandemic caused  substantial reduction in older adults' life-space mobility in Brazil. Social  inequalities strongly affected vulnerable groups. Concerted actions should be put in  place to overcome the deterioration in life-pace mobility amongst these groups.  Failure in minimizing health inequalities amplified by the pandemic may jeopardize  the desired achievements of the Decade of Healthy Aging.","2021","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","643640","","","9","","Front Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Perracini, de Amorim, Lima, da Silva, Trombini-Souza, Pereira, Pelicioni, Duim, Batista, dos Santos, de Lima and the REMOBILIZE Research Network  (CANSORT-SCI).","","","","","","PMID: 33898378  PMCID: PMC8062747","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; *COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; *health status disparities; *Pandemics; *participation; *Social Determinants of Health; *social distancing; *well-being; Brazil/epidemiology; Health Status Disparities; Linear Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have typically relied on community samples, cross-sectional data,  and suboptimal prospective designs. This study generates more robust evidence by  investigating the longitudinal associations between social isolation and physical  functioning in a large panel of older adults. METHODS: Analyses were based on 9  waves of data (2011-2019) from a sample of adults aged ≥65 years from the U.S.  National Health and Aging Trends Study (N=12,427 individuals; 54,860 person-year  observations) and within-individual fixed-effect panel regression models. Analyses  were conducted in 2020. Social isolation was measured using the Social Isolation  Index, and physical functioning was measured through the Short Physical Performance  Battery. RESULTS: In fully adjusted fixed-effect regression models, each 1-unit  increase in the Social Isolation Index resulted in an average decrease of 0.27 units  in the Short Physical Performance Battery (95% CI= -0.31, -0.24). This relationship  was moderated by age, with the Social Isolation Index bearing a significantly and  substantially stronger influence on the Short Physical Performance Battery at older  ages than at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that social isolation is  associated with deficits in physical functioning among older adults in the U.S.  using more robust data and methods than earlier studies. These findings highlight  the importance of incorporating strategies to reduce social isolation in policies  aimed at promoting successful aging.","2021-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","158-164","","2","61","","Am J Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Both cognitive functions and P3  component amplitude respond positively to exercise, but the effects of resistance  training on P3 are much less studied. Short-term resistance training interventions  in older adults indicate modulation towards larger P3 amplitude, but this  association has not been studied with a longitudinal study design. We investigated  magnetoencephalographically recorded P3 (P3m) in a unique study design of nine aged  men (mean age 77.7 y) with quasi-supervised resistance training background over a  10-year period and eight controls of similar age (mean age 77.5 y) with no training  background. We elicited P3m utilizing lower limb electrical stimulation, as the  resistance training program was mostly directed to lower limbs. Somatosensory  oddball paradigm was performed with the right foot's fourth toe as standard (90%)  and hallux as deviant (10%). Participants were asked to respond to deviants with a  button press using their left index finger. Topographic maps showed bilateral  temporoparietal activation for P3m in both groups. No amplitude differences were  found in active P3m regions between groups. However, the groups differed in  hemispheric activity of P3m. The exercise group showed stronger activation in the  right frontotemporal and parietal sensor-groups compared to the left sensor-groups,  and the control group showed stronger activation in right frontotemporal  sensor-group compared to left. The control group showed shorter P3m latency in the  right temporal sensor-group than the exercise group, but the latencies in other  sensor-groups were similar. In aging, the brain utilizes compensatory areas to  perform cognitive tasks. Our results suggest modulation in topographic distribution  of P3m activity in aging men with long-term resistance training background compared  to their controls. This might arise from a difference in age-related compensatory  mechanisms in P3m generation.","2021-07-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","111312","","","149","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We quantified how childhood circumstances  contribute to health in later life, both directly and indirectly, through their  effects on potential mediators. Methods: This study used three waves of data from  the national longitudinal survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal  Study (CHARLS). The final model in this study included 7,476 eligible respondents  aged 45 years and above. We constructed a simple health status measure based on the  first principal component of CHARLS survey responses with 25 health-related  information. It is a multi-dimensional measurement that comprehensively reflects the  individual's healthy aging. We formulated childhood circumstances factors into five  domains: childhood health and nutrition, childhood socioeconomic status, access to  health care, parental genetics, and adverse childhood experiences. Ordered logit  regression was conducted to analyze the relationship between health in middle and  later life and childhood circumstances, with other explanatory variables controlled.  Results: Controlling for educational attainment, personal income, and health status  in the last wave, adults who experience good childhood health (poor as the base,  coefficient 0.448, p < 0.01), and better family financial status (worse as the base,  coefficient 0.173, p < 0.01) have significantly better health during their middle  and later life, in comparison, being inconvenient to visit a doctor (coefficient  -0.178, p < 0.01), and having two or three adverse childhood experiences (0 as the  base, coefficient -0.148, p < 0.01) are significantly associated with poorer health.  Childhood circumstances appear to act both through a lasting effect of initial  health and financial status in childhood and through their impact on achievements in  adulthood. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that investments in health during  childhood not only contribute to health in later life but also dynamically improve  an individual's educational attainment and personal income, as well as other life  prospects. All these returns may extend far beyond childhood and continue throughout  the lifespan.","2021","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","642520","","","9","","Front Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 Tao, Shao and Hu.","","","","","","PMID: 33614591  PMCID: PMC7888477","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Retirement; *Healthy Aging; China; *childhood circumstances; *economic burden; *health disparity; *healthy aging; *life-course model; *middle-aged and elderly population; *panel data; *Social Class","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Data on  1,760 middle-aged participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity  Across the Life Span (HANDLS study: Age range at v(2): 33-71y, mean±SD:53.0±8.8, %  women: 58.4%, % African-American:60.3%) were used, with complete baseline  25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] serum concentration data, initial selected covariates  and mediators, and initial and/or follow-up data on five sub-scales (sleep duration,  daytime dysfunction, sleep disturbance, sleep latency and sleep quality) of the  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Mean±SD time between initial and follow-up visits:  4.1±1.5 years. Time-interval multiple mixed-effects linear regression models were  used. RESULTS: Upon multiple testing adjustment, among Whites, initial 25(OH)D was  associated with better sleep duration [25(OH)D × TIME γ±SE: -0.027±0.011, P=0.017]  and sleep quality [25(OH)D × TIME γ±SE: -0.026±0.010, P=0.008] over time, with  heterogeneity by race found for both relationships (P<0.05 for 25(OH)D × TIME × Race  in the un-stratified model). These relationships remained unaltered after further  adjustment for dietary and supplemental vitamin D, indicating that this association  may be largely explained by sunlight exposure. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included  small sample size, selection bias, residual confounding and lack of objective sleep  measures. Conclusions Vitamin D status, possibly through mechanisms involving  sunlight exposure, was linked to a potential improvement in sleep duration and  quality among White urban adults.","2021-03-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","858-868","","","282","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020.

However, the association between dietary patterns and IC is unclear. We aimed to investigate the prospective associations between dietary patterns and IC trajectories over a 3-year period in community-dwelling Japanese adults aged ≥ 60 years. Methods: A prospective cohort study which contained nutritional status, mental status, and physical function was used. A validated 34-item food frequency questionnaire was used to determine dietary intake and to derive five dietary patterns (""fruits and vegetables"", ""sugar and fat"", ""salt and pickles"", ""noodle and alcohol"", and ""protein-rich"") using principal component analysis. The composite IC score was calculated as the mean of the locomotion Z-score, cognition Z-score, psychological Z-score, vitality Z-score, and sensory regression score. A generalized estimating equation was applied for longitudinal analysis. Results: A total of 666 enrollees were included in the analysis. The mean baseline IC was 0.07 ± 0.47. The ""fruits and vegetables"" dietary pattern was positively associated with composite IC score changes after adjusting for confounders (Q4 vs. Q1: mean difference [0.069], P = 0.019). Similarly, a positive correlation was observed for the ""protein-rich"" dietary pattern with the composite IC score changes (Q4 vs. Q1: mean difference [0.092], Q3 vs. Q1: mean difference [0.101], Q2 vs. Q1: mean difference [0.083]; all P < 0.01). However, adherence to the ""sugar and fat"" dietary pattern was negatively associated with composite IC score changes (Q4 vs. Q1: mean difference [− 0.072], P = 0.026). Furthermore, the percentage of animal protein to total protein intake showed a significant incremental trend in the ""protein-rich"" dietary pattern (P for trend < 0.001). Conclusion: The ""fruits and vegetables"" and ""protein-rich"" (animal-based protein in particular) dietary patterns were positively associated with IC changes, whereas the ""sugar and fat"" dietary pattern was negatively associated with IC changes. Identification and promotion of healthy dietary patterns in older adults may inform future health policies and research.","2021-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:43:26","","3303-3313","","6","60","","Eur J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2021.

Its estimated prevalence is 40-50 % in people over 75 years of age. Recent studies agree that declinein  hearing threshold contribute to deterioration in sociality, sensitivity, cognition,  and quality of life for elderly subjects. The aim of the study presented in this  paper is to verify whether or not rehabilitation using first time applied Hearing  Aids (HA) in a cohort of old people with hearing impairment improves both speech  perception in a noisy environment over time and the overall health-related quality  of life. METHODS: The monocentric, prospective, repeated measurements,  single-subject, clinical observational study is to recruit 100 older adults,  first-time HA recipients (≥ 65 years).The evaluation protocol is designed to analyze  changes in specific measurement tools a year after the first HA usage in comparison  with the evaluation before HA fitting. Evaluations will consist of multiparametric  details collected through self-report questionnaires completed by the recipients and  a series of commonly used audiometric measures and geriatric assessment tools. The  primary indicator of changes in speech perception in noise to be used is the Italian  version of Oldenburg Satz (OLSA) test whereas the indicator of changes in overall  quality of life will be the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) and Hearing  Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) questionnaires. The Montreal Cognitive  Assessment (MoCA) will help in screening the cognitive state of the subjects.  DISCUSSION: The protocol is designed to make use of measurement tools that have  already been applied to the hearing-impaired population in order to compare the  effects of HA rehabilitation in the older adults immediately before first HA usage  (Pre) and after 1 year of experience (Post). This broad approach will lead to a  greater understanding of how useful hearing influences the quality of life in older  individuals, and therefore improves potentials for healthy aging. The data is to be  analyzed by using an intrasubject endpoint comparison. Outcomes will be described  and analyzed in detail.

A better  understanding on how to measure the true age of an individual or biological aging is  an essential step that may lead to the definition of putative markers capable of  predicting healthy aging. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the INStitute for  Prevention healthy agIng and medicine Rejuvenative (INSPIRE) Platform initiative is  to build a program for Geroscience and healthy aging research going from animal  models to humans and the health care system. The specific aim of the INSPIRE human  translational cohort (INSPIRE-T cohort) is to gather clinical, digital and imaging  data, and perform relevant and extensive biobanking to allow basic and translational  research on humans. METHODS: The INSPIRE-T cohort consists in a population study  comprising 1000 individuals in Toulouse and surrounding areas (France) of different  ages (20 years or over - no upper limit for age) and functional capacity levels  (from robustness to frailty, and even dependency) with follow-up over 10 years.  Diversified data are collected annually in research facilities or at home according  to standardized procedures. Between two annual visits, IC domains are monitored  every 4-month by using the ICOPE Monitor app developed in collaboration with WHO.  Once IC decline is confirmed, participants will have a clinical assessment and blood  sampling to investigate markers of aging at the time IC declines are detected.  Biospecimens include blood, urine, saliva, and dental plaque that are collected from  all subjects at baseline and then, annually. Nasopharyngeal swabs and cutaneous  surface samples are collected in a large subgroup of subjects every two years.  Feces, hair bulb and skin biopsy are collected optionally at the baseline visit and  will be performed again during the longitudinal follow up. EXPECTED RESULTS:  Recruitment started on October 2019 and is expected to last for two years.  Bio-resources collected and explored in the INSPIRE-T cohort will be available for  academic and industry partners aiming to identify robust (set of) markers of aging,  age-related diseases and IC evolution that could be pharmacologically or  non-pharmacologically targetable. The INSPIRE-T will also aim to develop an  integrative approach to explore the use of innovative technologies and a new,  function and person-centered health care pathway that will promote a healthy aging.","2021","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:37:39","","110-120","","2","10","","J Frailty Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33575699  PMCID: PMC7352084","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; France; Cohort Studies; Geriatrics; *Healthy Aging; *Biological Specimen Banks; *Geriatrics; *Translational Medical Research; biological aging; biology of aging; Gerosciences; integrated care; intrinsic capacity; translational research on aging; Healthy Aging; Biological Specimen Banks; Translational Medical Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively  estimate the frequency of priority conditions associated with declines in intrinsic  capacity according to an adaptation of the screening tool ICOPE Step 1 among  participants of the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). DESIGN: A  cross-sectional retrospective analysis from the baseline assessment of the MAPT.  SETTING: The data was gathered during a preventive consultation for cardiovascular  risk factors in memory clinics in France. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred fifty-nine  older adults aged 70-89 years with memory complaints, allocated to the multidomain  groups of the MAPT study. MEASUREMENTS: Five domains of intrinsic capacity  (cognition, locomotion, nutrition, sensorial, and psychological) were assessed using  a screening tool similar to the ICOPE Step 1 (MAPT Step 1). The frequency of six  conditions associated with declines in intrinsic capacity (cognitive decline,  limited mobility, malnutrition, visual impairment, hearing loss, and depressive  symptoms) was obtained for older adults with memory complaints participating in the  MAPT study. RESULTS: Overall, 89.3% of the participants had one or more conditions  associated with declines in intrinsic capacity. The overall frequency of each  condition was: 52.2% for cognitive decline, 20.2% for limited mobility, 6.6% for  malnutrition, 18.1% for visual impairment, 56.2% for hearing loss, and 39% for  depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: After being screened with an adaptation of the  ICOPE step 1 (MAPT step 1) tool, 9/10 older adults had one or more conditions  associated with declines in intrinsic capacity. The relative frequency differs  across conditions and could probably be lower in a population without memory  complaints.

This study evaluates the association between antioxidant  intake and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among older  Australian men. METHODS AND RESULTS: 794 men aged ≥75 years participated in the 3rd  wave of the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project. Dietary adequacy of  antioxidant intake was assessed by comparing participants' intake of vitamins A, E,  C and zinc to the Nutrient Reference Values (NRV) for Australia. Attainment of NRVs  of antioxidants was categorised into a dichotomised variable 'inadequate' (meeting≤2  of 4 antioxidants) or 'adequate' (meeting≥3 of 4 antioxidants). The usage of  antioxidant supplements was assessed. The outcome measure was MACE. The composite  MACE endpoint was defined as having one of the following: death, myocardial  infarction, ischemic stroke, congestive cardiac failure (CCF), and revascularization  during the period of observation. There was no significant association between  dietary (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.48) or supplemental antioxidant intake (HR: 1.10,  95% CI: 0.75, 1.63) and overall MACE. However, a significant association was  observed between inadequate antioxidant intake and CCF (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.16,  1.50). The lowest quartile of zinc intake (<11.00 mg/d) was significantly associated  with CCF (HR 2.36; 95% CI: 1.04, 5.34). None of the other antioxidants were  significantly associated with CCF or other MACE components. CONCLUSION: Inadequate  dietary antioxidant intake, particularly zinc, is associated with increased risk of  CCF in older Australian men but not associated with overall MACE.","2021-04-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1102-1112","","4","31","","Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis","","","","","","","","eng","Crown Copyright © 2020.

A general consensus in the literature is that  healthy longevity is an outcome of multiple factors, but the interrelationship  between good oral health and healthy aging remains not fully understood. As part of  the ""CaT: Centenari a Trieste"" study, a population-based cohort study set in  Trieste, Italy, we report here the results of subjective self-reported oral health  parameters and objective clinical and biological oral variables and their  association with cognitive impairment in 25 centenarians enrolled in the study from  September 2017 to May 2019. Oral health-related variables were recorded by means of  a self-evaluation questionnaire and a comprehensive oral examination of teeth,  prostheses and mucosae conducted by a trained dentist. In addition,  6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) taste perception and salivary oxidative stress markers,  specifically the Total Oxidative Status and Ferric Reducing Ability of Saliva, were  measured. Finally, the oral data obtained were compared with the presence or absence  of dementia in the enrolled subjects. The centenarians included in our study were  generally satisfied with their oral health. Among the causes of discomfort, the most  prevalent were difficulties in chewing and biting, with few subjects describing a  correlation between their oral health and psycho-social issues. We evaluated  possible relations of clinical and biological variables to the likelihood of being  demented and did not find significant associations. We found a higher though not  statistically significant mean salivary flow and antioxidant capacity of saliva in  non-demented subjects. When evaluating the PROP taste perception profile, we found a  higher proportion of supertasters compared with previous studies and different taste  perception profiles according to dementia. Despite the relatively small number of  participants, we believe that our study contributes to a better understanding of the  clinical and biological profile of the oral cavity in subjects aged over 100 years,  encouraging the inclusion of a comprehensive evaluation of the oral cavity in  centenarian studies performed worldwide.","2021-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:19:16","","31-37","","","145","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Guided  by the four healthy aging concepts in studies from the US and Spain, this study  sought to determine a useful definition for Korean older adults by examining the  associations between each of the four healthy aging definitions and mortality.  METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was conducted based on the 2,960 older people (65  years or older) who participated in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging  (2006-2014). Four healthy aging gradient definitions (Rowe and Kahn, Group Ⅰ, Group  II, and Group III) were determined: absence of disease, free of disability, physical  and cognitive function, and engagement with life. RESULTS: The young old who failed  to achieve healthy aging were found to have a higher risk of mortality in all four  healthy aging gradient definitions in both males (HR range from 4.15 to 5.39) and  females (HR range from 4.07 to 9.55). In old old, however, the unhealthy aging  mortality risk in Rowe and Kahn's definition was disappeared, but predominant  mortality risks were found in Group III for both male (HR = 3.16, 95% CI 1.67 -  5.98) and female (HR = 3.65, 95% CI 1.36 - 9.81) CONCLUSION: To promote healthy  aging, we suggest that the definition for the young old includes rigid disease  criteria, and old old emphasize functional ability. Age-specific aims for healthy  aging may be useful for defining healthy aging.","2021-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:04:57","","104333","","","94","","Arch Gerontol Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021.

Six medical measures of blood pressure, peak expiratory flow, cognitive status score, fasting glucose, kidney function and C-reactive function were used to construct CHAI (range 0-12, 0-2 = healthiest, 7-12 = unhealthiest). Ordinary least squares, logistic and random effects models examined social and spatial determinants of CHAI score and the prevalence of the ideal CHAI. Unconditional quantile regression tested heterogeneous impacts of sociodemographic determinants of CHAI score.Results: Mean CHAI score declined from 5.7 to 5.2, and the proportion of the ideal CHAI (CHAI score = 0-2) increased from 5.6 to 9.4% during 2011-2015, indicating an improvement in healthy ageing over time. During 2011-2015, the highest rates of the ideal CHAI were in Southeast and East of China. Older adults, male, living in the Center and West, smoking, obesity/overweight and having chronic diseases were positively associated with total CHAI score and negatively with a higher prevalence of the ideal CHAI. Being married, having high education and regular social activities were associated with a higher rate of the ideal CHAI. The positive predictors for total CHAI were stronger in those with worse CHAI status.Conclusions: In China healthy ageing has improved during 2011-2015, but substantial geographical and sociodemographic heterogeneities exist in the improvements, suggesting health equality remains a challenge in China. Future policies and interventions should especially focus on men, those in Central and West China, and combat health problems like obesity, chronic diseases and unhealthy behaviors.","2021-01-27","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:42:05","","78","","1","21","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33499807  PMCID: PMC7839192","","","","Aged; Humans; Male; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Retirement; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Healthy Aging; *Retirement; *Healthy ageing; China; China/epidemiology; *China; *Older adults; *Spatial characteristics; Social Readjustment Rating Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accumulative deficits in both molecular underpinnings and  functions in young adults with CP can lead to premature aging, such as heart disease  and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is an intermediate stage between healthy  aging and dementia that normally develops at old age. Owing to their intriguingly  parallel yet ""inverted"" disease trajectories, CP might share similar pathology and  phenotypes with MCI, conferring increased risk for developing dementia at a much  younger age. Thus, we examined this hypothesis by evaluating these two distinct  populations (MCI= 55, CP = 72). A total of nine measures (e.g., blood biomarkers,  neurocognition, Framingham Heart Study Score (FHSS) were compared between the  groups. Compared to MCI, upon controlling for covariates, delta FHSS, brain-derived  neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and systolic blood pressure were significantly  lower in CP. Intriguingly, high-sensitivity CRP, several metabolic outcomes, and  neurocognitive function were similar between the two groups. This study supports a  shared biological underpinning and key phenotypes between CP and MCI. Thus, we  proposed a double-hit model for the development of premature aging outcomes in CP  through shared biomarkers. Future longitudinal follow-up studies are warranted to  examine accelerated biological aging.","2021-01-26","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1773-1816","","2","13","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33497355  PMCID: PMC7880365","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Biomarkers; *aging model; *biomarker; *cerebral palsy; *community-dwelling older adults; *comparative study; Aging/blood/*psychology; Blood Pressure/*physiology; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*blood; Cerebral Palsy/blood/*diagnosis/psychology; Cognitive Dysfunction/blood/*diagnosis/psychology; Phenotype; Pilot Projects; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To investigate trajectories of cognitive functioning in  centenarians across domains, and to examine the association of these trajectories  with factors underlying cognitive reserve, physical health, and postmortem levels of  Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated neuropathology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  This cohort study used neuropsychological test data and postmortem neuropathological  reports from Dutch centenarians who were drawn from the 100-plus Study between  January 2013 and April 2019. Eligible participants self-reported being cognitively  healthy, which was confirmed by a proxy. Data analysis was performed between June  2019 and June 2020. EXPOSURES: Age, sex, APOE ε genotype, factors of cognitive  reserve, physical health, and AD-associated neuropathology (ie, amyloid-β,  neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaques). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In  annual visits (until death or until participation was no longer possible),  centenarians underwent an extensive neuropsychological test battery, from which an  mean z score of global cognition, memory, executive functions, verbal fluency,  visuospatial functions, and attention/processing speed was calculated. Linear mixed  models with a random intercept and time as independent variable were used to  investigate cognitive trajectories, adjusted for sex, age, education, and vision and  hearing capacities. In a second step, linear mixed models were used to associate  cognitive trajectories with factors underlying cognitive reserve, physical health at  baseline, and AD-associated neuropathology. RESULTS: Of the 1023 centenarians  approached, 340 were included in the study. We analyzed 330 centenarians for whom  cognitive tests were available at baseline (239 [72.4%] women; median [interquartile  range] age of 100.5 [100.2-101.7] years), with a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 1.6  (0.8) years. We observed no decline across investigated cognitive domains, with the  exception of a slight decline in memory function (β, -0.10 SD per year; 95% CI,  -0.14 to -0.05 SD; P < .001). Cognitive performance was associated with factors of  physical health (eg, higher Barthel index: β, 0.37 SD per year; 95% CI, 0.24-0.49;  P < .001) and cognitive reserve (eg, higher education: β, 0.41 SD per year; 95% CI,  0.29-0.53; P < .001), but none of these factors were associated with the rate of  decline. Neuropathological reports were available for 44 participants. While  centenarian brains revealed varying loads of postmortem neuropathological hallmarks  of AD, this was not associated with cognitive performance or rate of decline.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While we observed a slight vulnerability for decline in  memory function, centenarians maintained high levels of performance in all other  investigated cognitive domains for up to 4 years despite the presence of risk  factors of cognitive decline. These findings suggest that mechanisms of resilience  may underlie the prolongation of cognitive health until exceptional ages.","2021-01-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e2031654","","1","4","","JAMA Netw Open","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33449094  PMCID: PMC7811180","","","","Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; *Brain/pathology/physiopathology; *Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology/pathology/physiopathology; Alzheimer Disease/pathology/physiopathology; Autopsy; Cognition/*physiology; Netherlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Program 4 of the Healthy Aging in Industrial Environment study investigates whether  the health and wellbeing benefits of physical activity (PA) can be fully realized in  individuals living in highly polluted environments. Herein, we introduce the  behavioral, psychological and neuroimaging protocol of the study. METHODS: This is a  prospective cohort study of N = 1500 individuals aged 18-65 years comparing: (1)  individuals living in the highly polluted, industrial region surrounding the city of  Ostrava (n = 750), and (2) controls from the comparison region with relative low  pollution levels in Southern Bohemia (n = 750). Quota sampling is used to obtain  samples balanced on age, gender, PA status (60% active runners vs. 40%  insufficiently active). Participants are screened and complete baseline assessments  through online questionnaires and in-person lab-based assessments of physiological,  biomechanical, neuroimaging and cognitive function parameters. Prospective 12-month  intensive monitoring of air pollution and behavioral parameters (PA, inactivity, and  sleep) follows, with a focus on PA-related injuries and psychological factors  through fitness trackers, smartphones, and mobile apps. Subsequently, there will be  a 5-year follow-up of the study cohort. DISCUSSION: The design of the study will  allow for (1) the assessment of both short-term variation and long-term change in  behavioral parameters, (2) evaluation of the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries  and psychological factors impacting behavior and injury recovery, and (3) the impact  that air pollution status (and change) has on behavior, psychological resilience,  and injury recovery. Furthermore, the integration of MRI techniques and cognitive  assessment in combination with data on behavioral, biological and environmental  variables will provide an opportunity to examine brain structure and cognitive  function in relation to health behavior and air pollution, as well as other factors  affecting resilience against and vulnerability to adverse changes in brain structure  and cognitive aging. This study will help inform individuals about personal risk  factors and decision-makers about the impact of environmental factors on negative  health outcomes and potential underlying biological, behavioral and psychological  mechanisms. Challenges and opportunities stemming from the timing of the study that  coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.","2021-01-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","126","","1","21","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33435943  PMCID: PMC7801866","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; *Aging; *Exercise; Healthy Aging; Young Adult; *Air pollution; *Cognition; *Environment; *Health; *Neuroimaging; *Physical activity; Air Pollutants/analysis; Air Pollution/*adverse effects; Brain/diagnostic imaging/physiology; Cognition/physiology; COVID-19; Neuroimaging; Pyrimidines/chemistry; Research Design; Resilience, Psychological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  normative age-related values of such measures are still lacking. The aim of this  study was to provide normal values for 3D aortic morphological measures and  investigate their changes in aging and hypertension. This was a retrospective study,  in which 119 healthy controls (HC: 48 ± 14 years, 61 men) and 82 hypertensive  patients (HT: 60 ± 14 years, 43 men) were enrolled. 1.5 and 3 T/3D steady state free  precession or spoiled gradient echo were used. Automated 3D aortic segmentation  provided aortic length, diameter, volume for the ascending (AAo), and descending  aorta (DAo), along with cross-sectional diameters at three aortic landmarks. Age,  sex, body surface area (BSA), smoking, and blood pressures were recorded. Both  groups were divided into two subgroups (≤50 years, >50 years). Statistical tests  performed were linear regression for age-related normal values and confidence  intervals, Wilcoxon rank sum test for differences between groups (HC or HT), and  multivariate analysis to identify main determinants of aortic morphological changes.  In HC, linear regression revealed an increase in the AAo (respectively DAo) length  by 2.84 mm (7.78 mm), maximal diameter by 1.36 mm (1.29 mm), and volume by 4.28 ml  (8.71 ml) per decade. AAo morphological measures were higher in HT patients than in  HC both ≤50 years but did not reach statistical significance (length: +2 mm, p =  0.531; diameter: +1.4 mm, p = 0.2936; volume:+6.8 ml, p = 0.1857). However, length  (+6 mm, p = 0.003), maximal diameter (+4 mm, p < 0.001) and volume (+12 ml,  p < 0.001) were significantly higher in HT patients than in HC, both >50 years. In a  multivariate analysis, age, sex, and BSA were the major determinants of aortic  morphology, irrespective of the presence of hypertension. Global and segmental  aortic length, volume, and diameters at specific landmarks were automatically  measured from 3D MRI to serve as normative measures of 3D aortic morphology. Such  indices increased significantly with age and hypertension among the elderly  subjects.

We investigated the prevalence and long-term prognostic  significance of early repolarization pattern (ERP) on electrocardiograms (ECGs) in  the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study (HALST) cohort of 4615 middle-aged and  geriatric community-dwelling Han Chinese adults from Taiwan. The study subjects were  followed-up for 95±22 months. A positive ERP of ≥0.1 mV was observed in 889 (19.3%)  of the subjects. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that ERP was not  associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (log-rank test, P=0.13 and  0.84, respectively).

Age, and stroke were risk factors associated with  increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (P<0.05). However, ERP alone was not  associated with all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. These findings show that ERP  is common in the middle-aged and geriatric Han-Chinese individuals from the HALST  cohort and is not associated with all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.","2020-12-19","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:02:43","","26140-26187","","24","12","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33401252  PMCID: PMC7803508","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Mortality; Age Factors; Blood Pressure; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; *community-based; *early repolarization pattern; *Han Chinese population; *long-term prognosis; *prevalence; Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality; Cause of Death; Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology; Electrocardiography; Heart Ventricles/*physiopathology; Independent Living; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/epidemiology; Smoking/epidemiology; Stroke/epidemiology; Taiwan; Cardiovascular Diseases -- mortality; community-based; Diabetes Mellitus -- epidemiology; early repolarization pattern; Han Chinese population; Heart Ventricles -- physiopathology; long-term prognosis; prevalence; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic -- epidemiology; Smoking -- epidemiology; Stroke -- epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Does it  also predict how well people age? We studied the association between self-control  and midlife aging in a population-representative cohort of children followed from  birth to age 45 y, the Dunedin Study. We measured children's self-control across  their first decade of life using a multi-occasion/multi-informant strategy. We  measured their pace of aging and aging preparedness in midlife using measures  derived from biological and physiological assessments, structural brain-imaging  scans, observer ratings, self-reports, informant reports, and administrative  records. As adults, children with better self-control aged more slowly in their  bodies and showed fewer signs of aging in their brains. By midlife, these children  were also better equipped to manage a range of later-life health, financial, and  social demands. Associations with children's self-control could be separated from  their social class origins and intelligence, indicating that self-control might be  an active ingredient in healthy aging. Children also shifted naturally in their  level of self-control across adult life, suggesting the possibility that  self-control may be a malleable target for intervention. Furthermore, individuals'  self-control in adulthood was associated with their aging outcomes after accounting  for their self-control in childhood, indicating that midlife might offer another  window of opportunity to promote healthy aging.","2021-01-19","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 20:02:39","","","","3","118","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

STUDY DESIGN: We  analyzed 5-year data (1997-9 to 2002-4) from 1,085 adults aged 55+ years, who were  free of cancer, coronary artery disease and stroke at baseline and who had complete  data on sensory loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual impairment was defined as visual  acuity <20/40 (better eye), and hearing impairment as average pure-tone air  conduction threshold >25 dBHL (500-4000 Hz, better ear). Successful aging was  defined as the absence of: disability, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment,  respiratory symptoms and chronic diseases (cancer, coronary artery disease and  stroke) at 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, 243 (22.4%) participants  had died and 248 (22.9%) had aged successfully. After multivariable adjustment,  participants who had either best-corrected visual impairment or bilateral hearing  impairment, versus those who did not have sensory impairment at baseline, had 37%  reduced odds of successful aging after 5 years: OR 0.63 (95% CI 0.43-0.94).  Concurrent vision and hearing loss at baseline was not associated with 5-year aging  status. Participants with moderate and severe hearing handicap at baseline had 50%  and 61% reduced odds of aging successfully after 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION:  The presence of a single sensory impairment in older adults was associated with  reduced odds of being disease-free and fully functional or having aged successfully,  5 years later. Objectively measured hearing loss and self-perceived hearing  handicap, rather than vision loss, was more likely to negatively influence 5-year  aging status.","2021-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:46:35","","203-208","","","143","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to explore the association of low blood arsenic  with malondialdehyde in community-dwelling older adults. We used a cross-sectional  study of 2384 older adult individuals aged ≥65 years (mean age: 85 years) from the  Healthy Aging and Biomarkers Cohort Study in 2017. The median blood arsenic level  was 1.41 μg/L. High oxidative stress was categorized according to the 95th  percentile of MDA levels (7.47 nmol/mL). Restricted cubic spline models showed that  blood arsenic levels were positively associated with malondialdehyde levels  (P < 0.01); and the risk of high oxidative stress was no longer significantly  increased when blood arsenic level up to 8.74 μg/L. After adjusting for potential  confounders, the odds ratios of high oxidative stress for the second, third, and  fourth quartiles of blood arsenic were 2.35 (1.11-4.96), 3.87 (1.90-7.91), and 4.18  (2.00-8.72) (P(trend) < 0.01), compared with the first quartile.

This diversity limits the potential to  compare healthy ageing across countries and/or populations. In this study, we  developed a novel measurement scale of healthy ageing using worldwide cohorts.  METHODS: In the Ageing Trajectories of Health-Longitudinal Opportunities and  Synergies (ATHLOS) project, data from 16 international cohorts were harmonized.  Using ATHLOS data, an item response theory (IRT) model was used to develop a scale  with 41 items related to health and functioning. Measurement heterogeneity due to  intra-dataset specificities was detected, applying differential item functioning via  a logistic regression framework. The model accounted for specificities in model  parameters by introducing cohort-specific parameters that rescaled scores to the  main scale, using an equating procedure. Final scores were estimated for all  individuals and converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of  10. RESULTS: A common scale was created for 343 915 individuals above 18 years of  age from 16 studies. The scale showed solid evidence of concurrent validity  regarding various sociodemographic, life and health factors, and convergent validity  with healthy life expectancy (r = 0.81) and gross domestic product (r = 0.58).  Survival curves showed that the scale could also be predictive of mortality.  CONCLUSIONS: The ATHLOS scale, due to its reliability and global representativeness,  has the potential to contribute to worldwide research on healthy ageing.","2021-07-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:39:26","","880-892","","3","50","","Int J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

The asymptomatic behavior in the early stages makes the identification of the disease  onset particularly challenging. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary  stage between the expected decline of normal aging and the pathological decline  associated with dementia. The identification of risk factors for MCI is thus sorely  needed. Self-reported personal information such as age, education, income level,  sleep, diet, physical exercise, etc. is called to play a key role not only in the  early identification of MCI but also in the design of personalized interventions and  the promotion of patients empowerment. In this study, we leverage a large  longitudinal study on healthy aging in Spain, to identify the most important  self-reported features for future conversion to MCI. Using machine learning (random  forest) and permutation-based methods we select the set of most important  self-reported variables for MCI conversion which includes among others, subjective  cognitive decline, educational level, working experience, social life, and diet.  Subjective cognitive decline stands as the most important feature for future  conversion to MCI across different feature selection techniques.","2020-11-26","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:00:57","","20630","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33244011  PMCID: PMC7692490","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Exercise -- physiology; Female; Male; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Alzheimer Disease -- pathology; Sleep -- physiology; Spain; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/*pathology; Exercise/physiology; Machine Learning; Sleep/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective  population-based study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 14,159 participants  aged 45-74 years who were free from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes at  baseline (1993-1998) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study. METHODS: Dietary  intakes in midlife were assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire at  baseline. Diet quality was scored according to the alternate Mediterranean diet  (aMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the alternative  Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, overall plant-based diet index (PDI), and  healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI). Healthy ageing was assessed at the third  follow-up visit (2014-2016), which occurred about 20 years after the baseline visit,  and was defined as the absence of 10 chronic diseases, no impairment of cognitive  function, no limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no clinical  depression at screening, good overall self-perceived health, good physical  functioning, and no function-limiting pain among participants who had survival to at  least 65 years of age. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were  applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the  association between each dietary pattern score and healthy ageing. RESULTS: About  20.0% of participants met the healthy ageing criteria. The OR (95% CI) for healthy  ageing comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of diet quality scores was  1.52 (1.31-1.77) for aMED, 1.53 (1.35-1.73) for DASH, 1.39 (1.23-1.57) for  AHEI-2010, 1.34 (1.18-1.53) for PDI, and 1.45 (1.27-1.65) for hPDI (all  P-trend < .001). Each standard deviation increment in different diet quality scores  was associated with 12% to 18% higher likelihood of healthy ageing.

As a result of the epidemiological transition, the prevalence of diabetes has increased. This condition impacts not only individual lives, but also the healthcare system. The goal of this study is to examine the expected impact of diabetes, in terms of economic costs on the healthcare system and lives lost. We will also project how long it will take for the number of elderly individuals who are diabetic to double in Costa Rica. Methods: CRELES (Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study), a three-wave nationally representative longitudinal study, is the main source of data for this research (n = 2827). The projected impact of diabetes was estimated in three ways: length of time for the number of elderly individuals with diabetes to double; projected economic costs of diabetes-related hospitalizations and outpatient care; and years of life lost to diabetes at age 60. Data analyses and estimations used multiple regression models, longitudinal regression models, and Lee-Carter stochastic population projections. Results: Doubling time of the diabetic elderly population is projected to occur in 13 calendar years. This will cause increases in hospitalization and outpatient consultation costs. The impact of diabetes on life expectancy at age 60 around the year 2035 is estimated to lead to a loss of about 7 months of life. The rapid pace at which the absolute number of elderly people with diabetes will double is projected to result in a negative economic impact on the healthcare system. Lives will also be lost due to diabetes. Conclusion: Population aging will inevitably lead to an increasing number of elderly individuals, who are at greater risk for diabetes due to their lifelong exposure to risk factors. Actions to increase the quality of life of diabetic elderly are warranted. Decreasing the burden of diabetes on elderly populations and the Costa Rican healthcare system are necessary to impact the quantity and quality of life of incoming cohorts. Health promotion and prevention strategies that reduce diabetes risk factors are needed to improve the health of elderly populations.","2020-10-26","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:13:05","","172","","1","19","","Int J Equity Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33100218  PMCID: PMC7586658","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Longitudinal Studies; Population Dynamics; Quality of Life; Health Promotion; Prospective Studies; Funding Source; Human; Multiple Regression; *Cost of Illness; Costa Rica/epidemiology; Delivery of Health Care/*economics; Diabetes Mellitus/economics/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy; Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data; Life Expectancy/*trends; Costa Rica; Hospitalization -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Diabetes Mellitus -- Risk Factors; Diabetes Mellitus -- Epidemiology -- Costa Rica; Diabetes Mellitus -- Mortality -- In Old Age; Diabetic Patients -- Statistics and Numerical Data -- Costa Rica; Health Care Costs -- Costa Rica; Health Care Delivery -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the framework of Active Ageing, the exogenous latent  variables ""health"" and ""security"" are assumed to directly affect the endogenous  latent variable ""participation"", and indirectly affect it via mediating the function  of ""willingness"". The estimation results of the structural equation model show that  health has a significant positive impact, while security has a significant negative  impact on participation. In addition, health and security can significantly enhance  the willingness of older people to participate. After the opposite effects of health  and security are offset, their net effect on participation is generally negative.  According to these empirical results, this paper concludes that the optimization of  health coupled with the moderation of security level is more beneficial for  promoting the participation of older people.","2020-10-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","19","17","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 33020396  PMCID: PMC7579513","","","","Aged; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; *Healthy Aging; China; *health; *Aging/ethnology; *Community Participation; *Health Status; *Healthy Ageing; *latent variable; *structural equation modeling; Latent Class Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Musculoskeletal outcomes were  compared in older adults with normal adiposity and normal BMI (NA-NBMI), those with  high adiposity but normal BMI (HA-NBMI), and those with high adiposity and high BMI  (HA-HBMI). METHODS: In 3,411 70-year-olds, obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)  and adiposity as body fat percentage ≥ 25% (men) or ≥ 35% (women) from dual-energy  x-ray absorptiometry. Bone parameters were measured by dual-energy x-ray  absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Sarcopenia was  defined as low handgrip strength with or without low appendicular lean mass. Falls  were self-reported 6 and 12 months later. RESULTS: Prevalence of NA-NBMI, HA-NBMI,  and HA-HBMI was 14.2%, 68.1%, and 17.7%, respectively. Compared with HA-HBMI,  HA-NBMI had increased likelihood for sarcopenia (adjusted odds ratio: 3.99; 95% CI:  1.41-11.32) and osteoporosis (2.91; 95% CI: 2.35-3.61) but similar likelihood of  falls (P > 0.05). HA-NBMI had lower values for bone geometry parameters, as well as  grip strength, than both NA-NBMI and HA-HBMI (all P < 0.05).

However, there is a lack of reports of MRI-derived LV diastolic  properties in late diastole. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that cine MRI-derived  motion/deformation indices can be used to characterize age-related changes on LV  relaxation patterns in late diastole. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: In all,  412 participants (72.5 ± 4.6 years old, range 65-84) without a documented history of  cardiovascular diseases. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Balanced steady-state free  precession(bSSFP) acquired at 1.5T. ASSESSMENT: Participants were divided into  younger (65-74 years old, n = 275) and older (75-84 years old, n = 137) groups.  Status of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and lipid disorders were  recorded for each participant. Cine MRI datasets were analyzed by using heart  deformation analysis (HDA). LV motion/deformation indices (displacement, velocity,  strain, and strain rate) were measured through 22 phases within a cardiac cycle.  STATISTICAL TESTS: The prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk conditions, LV  ejection fraction (LVEF), peak LV regional displacement, velocity, and strain rates  at early and late diastole were compared between two participant groups using  chi-square tests or t-tests. RESULTS: Older participants had a significantly lower  peak early radial displacement (0.797 ± 0.249 cm vs. 0.876 ± 0.286 cm), radial  velocity (19.3 ± 6.3 mm/s vs. 17.5 ± 5.2 mm/s), and circumferential strain rate  (64.6 ± 15.7%/s vs. 70.1 ± 17%/s) but a higher peak late circumferential strain rate  (69.8 ± 16.3 %/s vs. 66 ± 15.8 %/s) than their younger counterparts.

We sought to provide  researchers, in the context of a clinical cohort study of delirium in older adults,  with guidance on the methodological tools to use data from clinical cohorts to  better understand medication risk factors and outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort  study. SETTING: The Successful Aging After Elective Surgery (SAGES) prospective  cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 560 older adults (aged ≥70 years) without dementia  undergoing elective major surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Using the SAGES clinical cohort,  methods used to characterize medications were identified, reviewed, analyzed, and  distinguished by appropriateness and degree of validation for characterizing  pharmacoepidemiologic data in smaller clinical data sets. RESULTS: Medication coding  is essential; the American Hospital Formulary System, most often used in the United  States, is not preferred over others. Use of equivalent dosing scales (e.g.,  morphine equivalents) for a single medication class (e.g., opioids) is preferred  over multiclass analgesic equivalency scales. Medication aggregation from the same  class (e.g., benzodiazepines) is well established; the optimal prevalence breakout  for aggregation remains unclear. Validated scale(s) to combine structurally  dissimilar medications (e.g., anticholinergics) should be used with caution; a lack  of consensus exists regarding the optimal scale. Directed acyclic graph(s) are an  accepted method to conceptualize causative frameworks when identifying potential  confounders. Modeling-based strategies should be used with evidence-based, a priori  variable-selection strategies.

Given research associating food  insecurity with higher risk of premature mortality, our objective was to determine  the likelihood that food-insecure adults with incomes below the national median  would live past 65 to collect the public pension. METHODS: We linked respondents of  the Canadian Community Health Survey 2005-15 to the death records from the Canadian  Vital Statistics Database 2005-17. We assessed household food insecurity status  through a validated 18-item questionnaire for 50,780 adults aged 52-64 at interview  and with household income below the national median. We traced their vital status up  to the age of 65. We fitted Cox proportional hazard models to compare hazard of  all-cause mortality before 65 by food insecurity status while adjusting for  individual demographic attributes, baseline health, and household socioeconomic  characteristics. We also stratified the sample by income and analyzed the subsamples  with income above and below the Low Income Measure separately. RESULTS: Marginal,  moderate, and severe food insecurity were experienced by 4.1, 7.3, and 4.5% of the  sampled adults, respectively. The crude mortality rate was 49 per 10,000  person-years for food-secure adults and 86, 98, and 150 per 10,000 person-years for  their marginally, moderately, and severely food-insecure counterparts, respectively.  For the full sample and low-income subsample, respectively, severe food insecurity  was associated with 1.24 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.45) and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.52) times  higher hazard of dying before 65 relative to food security. No association was found  between food insecurity and mortality in the higher-income subsample. CONCLUSIONS:  Severely food-insecure adults approaching retirement age were more likely to die  before collecting public pensions that might attenuate their food insecurity.  Policymakers need to acknowledge the challenges to food security and health faced by  working-age adults and provide them with adequate assistance to ensure healthy  ageing into retirement.","2020-10-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:58:35","","1484","","1","20","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32998712  PMCID: PMC7528377","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Health; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Mortality; Canada; *Food Insecurity; *Food Supply; Canada/epidemiology; Food insecurity; Pension; Pensions; Seniors; Canada -- epidemiology; Food Insecurity; Food Supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is limited knowledge regarding the  association of household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel use with sleep quality,  particularly among the population at advanced ages. The aim of this study is to  investigate this association in oldest-old (≥80 years) populations. METHODS: China  Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study was conducted in the 18 cities and counties of  Hainan Province from 2015 to 2017. A total of 1725 individuals aged 80 years and  older were included in the study. We used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI)  to measure individuals' sleep quality with a score of PSQI >8 indicating poor sleep  quality. Solid fuel users were defined as those who primarily use coal, biomass  charcoal, wood or straw for cooking in their daily life. The propensity score  matching (PSM) was adopted and logistic regressions were performed based on the  matched sample to estimate the association between the two factors. We adjusted for  a wide range of covariates, including demographic, socioeconomic, health-related,  and environmental factors. RESULTS: After matching, a total of 1616 participants  (mean [SD] age, 94.5 [9.5] years; 72.5% women) were included in the final analysis.  About 50.9% of the participants used solid fuel for cooking. The average global PSQI  score was 8.26 (SD = 3.3), 49.0% of them were detected as poor sleep quality with a  global PSQI score >8. We found significantly higher risk of having poor sleep  quality among those who were currently solid fuel users than among clean fuel users,  with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.14-1.80), adjusting for a wide range of  confounders. The associations were more pronounced in those who did not use any  ventilation (compared to those who used either mechanical or natural cooking  ventilation; 1.79 [1.30-2.47] vs. 1.27 [1.01-1.53], P for interaction = 0.016) and  in those who were frequent cooking at home (compared to those who never cooked; 1.65  [1.21-2.26] vs. 1.18 [0.93-1.40], P for interaction = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure  to HAP from solid fuel combustion increases the risk of poor sleep quality at  oldest-old ages. Our findings point to the need of reducing HAP from polluted fuel  combustion and implementing cooking ventilation as a public health priority for  healthy aging initiatives.","2020-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:42:17","","110229","","","191","","Environ Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This puts focus on maintaining functional ability and independence into older age. Individuals from lower social classes are at greater risk of developing limitations in physical function later in life. In this study, we investigated the mediating role of working conditions in the association between occupation-based social class and physical function measured as self-reported mobility limitations and objectively measured physical impairment in older age.Methods: Two Swedish surveys, linked at the individual level, were used (n = 676-814 depending on the outcome). Follow-up time was 20-24 years. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for age, sex, level of education, mobility, and health problems at baseline. This was followed by analyses of the size of the mediating effect of working conditions.Results: Working conditions seem to mediate 35-74% of the association between social class and physical impairment in older age. The pattern of mediation was primarily driven by passive jobs, i.e., low psychological demands and low control, among blue-collar workers. Working conditions did not mediate the association between social class and self-reported mobility limitations in older age.Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that working conditions are important in combating the social gradient in healthy aging, contributing to the evidence regarding the magnitude of impact exerted by both the physical and psychosocial work environment separately and in conjunction.","2020-09-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:17:50","","1360","","1","20","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32887580  PMCID: PMC7487473","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Social Class; Scales; Self Report; *Social Class; Sweden; *Mobility Limitation; *Occupations; Healthy aging; Longitudinal; Mobility; Older age; Physical function; Physical impairment; Physical working conditions; Psychosocial working conditions; Social class; Workplace; Middle Age; Symptoms; Occupations and Professions; Work Environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A sample of 74 elderly individuals aged ≥ 80  years, from the Veranópolis Project cohort, was selected for APOE genotyping. At  baseline, anthropometric variables, glucose and lipid levels, blood pressure, and  lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) were  collected. The Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale was applied to their  caregivers. Total study follow-up was 21 years. Two-sided p < 0.05 was considered  statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no association between APOE genotypes  and mortality. However, the risk of death in elderly smokers was 2.30 times higher  (hazard ratio [HR], 95% CI 1.01 to 5.24); in individuals with diabetes, it was 3.95  times higher (HR, 95% CI 1.27 to 12.30) than in individuals without diabetes.

Moreover, having ineffective binaural hearing increases difficulty  understanding speech in noise and leads to a greater degree of social isolation and  loneliness and a reduced quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVE: To explore the  audiometric and holistic effects of cochlear implantation in a group of adults 65  years or older compared with an optimized bilateral hearing aid condition. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ad hoc secondary analysis of a prospective,  single-subject, repeated-measures nonrandomized clinical trial included 13 cochlear  implantation centers across the United States. Participants 65 years or older with  postlingual bilateral moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss with aided  Consonant-Vowel Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) word scores in quiet of 40% or less in the  ear to undergo implantation and 50% or less in the contralateral ear were included  in the analysis. Baseline QoL testing was performed after 1 month of optimized  bilateral hearing aid use. Participants were enrolled from February 20, 2017, to May  3, 2018, and follow-up was completed December 21, 2018. Data were analyzed from  March 25, 2019, to March 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Unilateral implantation with a  slim, modiolar cochlear implant device. Hearing aid use in the contralateral ear was  required through the 6-month primary end-point interval. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  The primary objective was to evaluate speech perception before and 6 months after  activation of a new cochlear implant. Secondary objectives were QoL metrics in the  everyday listening condition before and 6 months after implantation. RESULTS:  Seventy participants (51 men [73%]) with a median age of 74 (range, 65-91) years  were included in the analysis. No major adverse events occurred. Mixed-model  analysis with estimated marginal means and 95% CIs compared preimplantation baseline  performance with 6-month postimplantation performance. A clinically important  improvement in CNC words was shown in the bimodal condition, with a mean difference  of 37.2% (95% CI, 32.0%-42.4%), and in the unilateral (cochlear implant only)  condition, with a mean difference of 44.1% (95% CI, 39.0%-49.2%). A clinically  important improvement in noise (AzBio sentences signal-to-noise ratio of +10 dB) was  also shown, with a mean difference of 21.6% (95% CI, 15.7%-27.5%) in the bimodal  condition and 24.5% (95% CI, 18.3%-30.7%) in the unilateral condition. The Health  Utilities Index Mark 3 multiple-attribute score improved by 0.186 (95% CI,  0.136-0.234); the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale total score  improved by 2.58 (95% CI, 2.18-2.99); and a novel Device Use Questionnaire reported  94% of participants were satisfied with overall hearing in the everyday listening  condition. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This subgroup analysis of patients 65 years or  older enrolled in a within-subject clinical trial of cochlear implantation  demonstrated clinically meaningful audiometric and QoL benefit with an acceptable  risk profile. These findings suggest that cochlear implantation in older adults may  facilitate the concept of healthy aging.

In  contrast with prior efforts focusing on connections at a distance or online  communities where the digital technology is the interface, we explore the design  opportunities and role of technology for connectedness within a geographically local  community context. We present findings from interviews with 22 older adults and a  linked ideation workshop. Our analysis identified shared concerns and negative  perceptions around local relationships, connections and characteristics of the  geographical area. However, local connectedness through technology was largely  absent from day-to-day life and even perceived as contributing to disconnection. By  uncovering how older adults use and perceive technology in their social lives and  combining these findings with their ideas for improving local connections, we  highlight the need for thoughtful consideration of the role of technology in  optimising social connections within communities. Our research highlights a need for  design work to understand the specifics of the local context and reduce emphasis on  technology as the interface between people. We introduce an amended  definition-'underpinned by a commitment to respect and social inclusion, an  age-friendly community is engaged in a strategic and ongoing process to facilitate  active ageing by optimising the community's physical, social and digital  environments and its supporting infrastructure'-to conceptualise our approach. We  conclude by suggesting areas for future work in developing digitally connected  age-friendly communities.","2020-07-31","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","15","17","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32751898  PMCID: PMC7432362","","","","Aged; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; *Social Support; Healthy Aging; *Environment; *older people; *age-friendliness; *ageing; *community; *connectedness; *digital technology; *Inventions; *isolation; *later life; *loneliness; *social relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report initial findings from a sample of 102 cognitively  unimpaired participants (average age 77.2 years, 54.9% women, 13.7% APOE*4 carriers)  recruited for neuroimaging from a larger representative population-based cohort  participating in an ongoing longitudinal study of aging, the  Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT). All participants scored < 1.0  on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, with 8 participants (7.8%) scoring  CDR = 0.5. Participants completed a positron emission tomography scan using the  tracers [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and [F-18]AV-1451 to estimate amyloid and  tau deposition. PiB positivity was defined on a regional basis using established  standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs (SUVR; cerebellar gray matter reference),  with 39 participants (38.2%) determined to be PiB(+). Health history, lifestyle, and  cognitive abilities were assessed cross-sectionally at the nearest annual parent  MYHAT study visit. A series of adjusted regression analyses modeled cognitive  performance as a function of global PiB SUVR and [F-18]AV-1451 SUVR in Braak  associated regions 1, 3/4, and 5/6. In comparison to PiB(-) participants (n = 63),  PiB(+) participants were older, less educated, and were more likely to be APOE*4  carriers. Global PiB SUVR was significantly correlated with [F-18]AV-1451 SUVR in  all Braak-associated regions (r = .38-0.53, p < .05). In independent models, higher  Global PiB SUVR and Braak 1 [F-18]AV-1451 SUVR were associated with worse  performance on a semantic interference verbal memory test. Our findings suggest that  brain amyloid is common in a community-based setting, and is associated with tau  deposition, but both pathologies show few associations with concurrent cognitive  performance in a dementia-free sample.","2021-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1355-1363","","3","15","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020.

STUDY DESIGN: Participants (mean age = 66) were drawn from two waves of a  longitudinal study of aging (n = 2910) in 2016 and 2018. Regression analyses tested  the main and interaction effects of intrinsic capacity and neighborhood factors on  health-related QoL at T2 (controlling for T1). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intrinsic  capacity was assessed with number of chronic conditions. Neighborhood perceptions  was assessed with measures of housing suitability, neighborhood satisfaction, and  neighborhood social cohesion. Health-related QoL was assessed with SF12 physical and  mental health component scores. RESULTS: Perceptions of greater neighborhood  accessibility and more trust among neighbours were associated with better mental  health-related QoL two years later, but not to changes in physical health-related  QoL. A significant interaction between intrinsic capacity and neighborhood access to  facilities on physical health-related QoL over time showed that those reporting  lower neighborhood access experienced a stronger impact of intrinsic capacity on  physical health-related QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The neighborhood environment is important  to the wellbeing of older people and is amenable to policy interventions. We need  more work on the aspects of the immediate environment that support QoL in older age.  This study points to the need for accessible facilities and cohesive neighborhoods  to support health.","2020-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1-5","","","139","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of 1,264  participants aged 60 years or older at baseline (2013-2014) living in suburban  areas, China. Sarcopenia was defined according to the recommended algorithm of AWGS.  Muscle mass was measured by a direct segmental multifrequency bioelectrical  impedance analysis. Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip strength, and physical  performance measured via usual walking speed. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazard  models were used to assess the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. After 40 months  of follow-up, forty-eight deaths (4.2%) died in this cohort. The mortality rate with  sarcopenia was 4.7% in men and 3.8% in women. After adjusting for potential  confounders, the risk of all-cause death was 4.15 times higher in subjects with  sarcopenia. Furthermore, low muscle mass (HR: 2.62, 95% CI 1.34-5.13) and low grip  strength (HR: 5.79; 95% CI 2.28-14.71), but not walking speed, were found to be  significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Risk of CVD mortality was  significantly greater in sarcopenia. Low grip strength and low walking speed were  associated with 11 times (HR: 11.03, 95% CI 1.58-77.02) and 13 times (HR: 13.02; 95%  CI 1.18-143.78) higher risk of CVD mortality.

METHODS: KHANDLE enrolled  community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years living in northern California. Participants  completed a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to measure six sleep components  and a global sleep score (scored 0-24). Covariates included age, sex, central  adiposity, education, income, alcohol consumption, ever smoking, physical activity,  and depression. Ordinal logistic regression was used to model sleep component scores  across race/ethnic groups. Linear regression was used to assess racial/ethnic  differences in global sleep score and the association between risk factors and  global sleep score. RESULTS: 1,664 participants with a mean age of 76 (SD=7) and  mean global sleep score of 6 (SD=4) were analyzed. Using Latinos as reference  (highest average sleep score), Blacks had an average .96 (.37, 1.54) unit higher  global sleep score (worse sleep) while Asians [β: .04 (-.56, .63)] and Whites [β:  .28 (-.29, .84)] did not significantly differ.

We investigated the association of SES with  mortality among older Australian men. We also investigated potential mediating  effects of health-related behaviours in SES-mortality associations. METHODS: We used  data from a prospective population-based cohort (the Concord Health and Aging in Men  Project), in Sydney, Australia. The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific  mortality. Educational attainment, occupational position, source of income, housing  tenure, and a cumulative SES score were assessed at baseline. Longitudinally  assessed alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and body mass index were  investigated as potential mediators. Associations were quantified using Cox  regression. RESULTS: We evaluated 1527 men (mean age: 77.4 ± 5.5 years). During a  mean follow-up time of 9.0 years, 783 deaths occurred. For deaths from all causes,  the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the lowest tertile of cumulative SES score versus  the highest tertile was 1.44 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.70); the corresponding sub-HRs were  1.35 (0.96 to 1.89) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality; 1.58 (1.15 to 2.18)  for cancer mortality, and 1.86 (1.36 to 2.56) for non-CVD, non-cancer mortality.  SES-mortality associations were attenuated by 11-25% after adjustment for mediating  health-related behaviours.

Life-space restriction is  potentially related to cognitive status. We examined the longitudinal association  between life-space mobility and changes in cognitive function in community-dwelling  older adults in different social settings of North and South America and Europe. We  used data from 1486 participants of the International Mobility in Aging Study  (IMIAS) conducted at five sites: Tirana (Albania), Natal (Brazil), Manizales  (Colombia), Kingston and Saint-Hyacinthe (Canada). Life-space mobility was assessed  using the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) questionnaire at baseline (2012), and the  Leganes Cognitive Test was used to evaluate cognitive function at baseline and  follow-up (2016). The Quantile regressions (QR) were used to evaluate the factors  associated with cognitive score in 2016 by adjusting for the cognitive score in  2012, with two distinct models for analyzing variables. A decrease in the cognitive  function was observed at all research sites, except in Manizales. Participants with  more restricted life-space at baseline had a decrease in their cognitive function  4 years later (β = -0.79, 95% CI: -1.400 to -0.18, p value<0.01) compared to those  with the highest level. This decrease was independent of gender, age, research site,  education, income sufficiency, social support, depression, cognitive function at  baseline, chronic conditions and physical performance. Restriction in life-space is  an important prognostic factor for cognitive function. Maintaining life-space can be  a goal in public policies aimed at encouraging healthy aging, and might be useful in  clinical practice to promote health status and to monitor older people at higher  risk of cognitive decline.","2020-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","237-254","","3","35","","J Cross Cult Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 32725292","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Social Support; Older adults; Canada; *Mobility Limitation; Mobility; Albania; Brazil; Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis; Colombia; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Independent Living/*psychology; Life-space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be able to design effective interventions, it  is essential to know which sedentary and physical behaviour domains (eg, at home or  during leisure time) have potential to facilitate healthy ageing during the  retirement transition. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether unfavourable sedentary and  physical activity behaviour before retirement predict unfavourable sedentary and  physical activity behaviour after retirement. DESIGN: Population-based cohort.  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n=3272) employed in 2010 but retired in 2014.  METHODS: Self-reported preretirement job activity, sedentary leisure time, physical  activity at home, and walking-cycling and exercise were assessed as predictors for  unfavourable sedentary and physical activity behaviours after retirement using  logistic regression. Unfavourable behaviours were defined based on the respective  median of the cohort distribution. Furthermore, the OR for having multiple  unfavourable behaviours after retirement was determined, based on the amount of  unfavourable behaviours before retirement. All models were adjusted for gender and  education. RESULTS: Unfavourable preretirement physical activity and sedentary  behaviour at home or during leisure time were the strongest predictors of the same  behaviours after retirement. Unfavourable job activity did not predict physical  activity but did predict unfavourable sedentary behaviour after retirement (OR=1.66,  95% CI 1.41 to 1.96). Unfavourable exercise behaviour before retirement predicted  unfavourable sedentary and physical activity after retirement in all domains. With  all behaviours being unfavourable before retirement, the OR of having at least three  unfavourable behaviours after retirement was 36.7 (95% CI 16.8 to 80.5).  CONCLUSIONS: Adults with a higher number of unfavourable preretirement physical  activity and sedentary behaviours are likely to carry these unfavourable behaviours  into retirement age. Interventions should target those with more unfavourable  preretirement physical activity and sedentary behaviours before retirement, and  those interventions focusing on exercise might have greatest potential.","2020-07-28","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:23:03","","e037659","","7","10","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Our study objective is to show that rehabilitation with cochlear implant treatment  in the elderly with hearing impairment improves the overall health-related quality  of life and general well-being that translate into healthy aging. METHODS: The  multicentre, prospective, repeated measures, single-subject, clinical observational  study will accrue 100 elderly, first-time, unilateral CI recipients (≥ 60 years) and  analyze changes on specific measurement tools over ca. 20 months from preimplant to  postimplant. Evaluations will consist of details collected through case history and  interview questionnaires by clinicians, data logging, self-report questionnaires  completed by the recipients and a series of commonly used audiometric measures and  geriatric assessment tools. The primary indicator of changes in overall quality of  life will be the HUI-3. DISCUSSION: The protocol is designed to make use of  measurement tools that have already been applied to the hearing-impaired population  in order to compare effects of CI rehabilitation in adults immediately before their  implantation, (pre-implant) and after gaining 1-1.5 years of experience  (post-implant). The broad approach will lead to a greater understanding of how  useful hearing impacts the quality of life in elderly individuals, and thus improves  potentials for healthy aging.

METHODS: In a  longitudinal observational cohort study, 100 former participants of the Ginkgo  Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS; 2000-2008) completed biannual Pittsburgh compound  B-PET imaging and annual clinical-cognitive evaluations beginning in 2010. Most  recent Aβ status and cognitive status were selected for each participant.  Longitudinal outcomes included change in serial Aβ and cognitive tests. Baseline  predictors from GEMS included neuropsychological tests, daily functioning, APOE  genotype, lifestyle variables, occupational measures, health history, sleep,  subjective memory, physical and cognitive activities, depressive symptoms, and  physical performance and health indices, among others. RESULTS: Mean age at the last  cognitive evaluation was 92.0 (range 86-100) years. Mean follow-up time from  baseline to last measured Aβ status was 12.3 (SD 1.9) years and to last cognitive  evaluation was 14.1 (SD 1.9) years. The APOE*2 allele predicted last Aβ status (n =  34 Aβ negative vs n = 66 Aβ positive). Baseline cognition predicted cognitive status  (n = 30 unimpaired vs n = 70 impaired). Predictors of cognitive status among  Aβ-positive participants only (n = 14 normal cognition vs n = 52 impaired) were  baseline cognitive test scores and smoking history. Baseline pulse pressure  predicted longitudinal Aβ increase; paid work engagement and life satisfaction  predicted less cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE*2 allele and lower pulse  pressure predict resistance to Aβ deposition in advanced aging.

This study aimed to investigate whether 2 different instruments,  the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) and the single question on FOF and  activity restriction (SQ-FAR), were associated with incident disability at 3 years.  DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants  (n = 1219, 57.4% women) were disability-free community-dwelling persons enrolled in  the Lausanne cohort 65+, aged 66 to 71 years, in 2005. MEASURES: Baseline covariates  included demographic, cognitive, affective, and health status. Basic activities of  daily living (BADL) assessment was recorded annually from a self-administered  questionnaire. Disability outcome was defined as reporting difficulty or help needed  in ≥1 of 5 BADL in ≥2 consecutive years, or being institutionalized during  follow-up. RESULTS: At 3 years, disability was reported by 77 participants (6.3%).  Reporting the highest level of fear at FES-I [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.14, 95%  confidence interval (CI) 1.82-14.55, P = .002] or ""FOF with activity restriction""  with SQ-FAR (aOR 3.23, 95% CI 1.29-8.08, P = .012) were both associated with  increased odds of disability even after adjusting for covariates. The FES-I model  explained incident disability slightly better than the SQ-FAR one [Bayesian  information criterion (BIC) values of 466.70 and 469.43, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS  AND IMPLICATIONS: High FOF and related activity restriction, assessed with FES-I and  SQ-FAR, are associated with incident disability in young-old community-dwelling  people. The SQ-FAR is suitable as a screening tool to proactively detect a  potentially reversible risk factor for disability. Using the FES-I may serve  additional clinical purposes, such as FOF characterization and management.","2021-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","464-467.e4","","2","22","","J Am Med Dir Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

We aimed to identify how physical activity can influence healthy ageing  trajectories using a harmonised dataset of eight ageing cohorts across the world.  METHODS: Based on a harmonised dataset of eight ageing cohorts in Australia, USA,  Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Europe, comprising 130,521 older adults  (M(age) = 62.81, SD(age) = 10.06) followed-up up to 10 years (M(follow-up) = 5.47,  SD(follow-up) = 3.22), we employed growth mixture modelling to identify latent  classes of people with different trajectories of healthy ageing scores, which  incorporated 41 items of health and functioning. Multinomial logistic regression  modelling was used to investigate the associations between physical activity and  different types of trajectories adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and  other lifestyle behaviours. RESULTS: Three latent classes of healthy ageing  trajectories were identified: two with stable trajectories with high (71.4%) or low  (25.2%) starting points and one with a high starting point but a fast decline over  time (3.4%). Engagement in any level of physical activity was associated with  decreased odds of being in the low stable (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.19) and fast  decline trajectories groups (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.50) compared to the high  stable trajectory group. These results were replicated with alternative physical  activity operationalisations, as well as in sensitivity analyses using reduced  samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a positive impact of physical activity on  healthy ageing, attenuating declines in health and functioning. Physical activity  promotion should be a key focus of healthy ageing policies to prevent disability and  fast deterioration in health.","2020-07-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:38:31","","92","","1","17","","Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32677960  PMCID: PMC7364650","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Europe; Health Status; Japan; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; United States -- epidemiology; Health Policy; Health Promotion; United States; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Australia; Confidence Intervals; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Models, Theoretical; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Comparative Studies; *Healthy Aging; Europe/epidemiology; Australia/epidemiology; Republic of Korea/epidemiology; *Exercise; Healthy Aging; *Physical activity; Latent Class Analysis; United States/epidemiology; *Data harmonisation; *Growth mixture modelling; *Health metric; *Life Style; *Lifestyle behaviours; Japan/epidemiology; Mexico/epidemiology; Mexico; Physical activity; Australia -- epidemiology; Data harmonisation; Europe -- epidemiology; Growth mixture modelling; Health metric; Japan -- epidemiology; Lifestyle behaviours; Mexico -- epidemiology; Republic of Korea -- epidemiology; Middle Age; Multiple Logistic Regression; Physical Activity; South Korea; Growth; Latent Structure Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are not evaluated  routinely in current health systems. In the Center for Successful Aging with  Diabetes, patients over the age of 60 undergo multi-disciplinary evaluation days and  are provided with an integrated (cognitive, physical, nutritional, and medical)  treatment plan. Among individuals with below-normal cognitive function,  self-adherence to these recommendations poses a challenge. Thus, the aim of this  study was to test the feasibility of a multidisciplinary intervention amongst older  people with diabetes with below-normal cognitive function and sub-optimal glucose  control. Methods: Patients with a MoCA score under 26 and A1C >= 7.5% participated  in a two-arm intervention: (A) a medical intervention: monthly meetings with a  diabetes nurse-educator, supervised by a diabetes specialist and study psychologist  during which changes in their pharmacological regimen of glucose, blood pressure,  and lipid control were made and (B) a cognitive/physical rehabilitation  intervention. This arm consisted of (1) an intensive phase-group meetings which  included computerized cognitive training, aerobic, balance, and strength exercise,  and group discussions and (2) a monthly consolidation phase. Outcomes included  change in A1C, change in strength, balance, and aerobic exercise capacity as well as  change in quality of life. Results: After 12 months there was a 0.7% reduction in  A1C. After 3 months there was a statistically significant improvement in physical  indices, including aerobic capacity (6-min walk), balance (FSST) and indices  assessing the risk of fall (10-meter walk, time up and go). There was no additional  improvement in physical indices between the 3 and 12 month visits. For some of the  physical measures, the improvement observed after 3 months persisted partially to  the 12-month visit. Conclusions: This feasibility study provides preliminary data  that support the efficacy of the complex interventions described. The findings  suggest that this older population would require an ongoing ""intensive phase""  intervention. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","348","","","11","","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Natovich, Gayus, Azmon, Michal, Gury Twito, Yair, Raudoi, Kapra and Cukierman-Yaffe.","","","","","","PMID: 32670196  PMCID: PMC7326129","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Prognosis; *Exercise; *aging; *Quality of Life; *A1C; *cognition; *diabetes; *intervention; Accidental Falls/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data; Aging/*pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy; Diabetes Mellitus/*physiopathology; Feasibility Studies; Israel/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A total of 1,315 women (age 65-80 years) free  of dementia were enrolled in an observational study between 1996 and 1999 and  underwent structural brain MRI in 2005 to 2006. According to prospectively collected  and geocoded participant addresses, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate the  3-year average PM(2.5) exposure before the MRI. We examined the joint associations  of baseline LCn3PUFAs in red blood cells (RBCs) and PM(2.5) exposure with brain  volumes in generalized linear models. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential  confounders, participants with higher levels of RBC LCn3PUFA had significantly  greater volumes of white matter and hippocampus. For each interquartile increment  (2.02%) in omega-3 index, the average volume was 5.03 cm(3) (p < 0.01) greater in  the white matter and 0.08 cm(3) (p = 0.03) greater in the hippocampus. The  associations with RBC docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid levels were  similar. Higher LCn3PUFA attenuated the inverse associations between PM(2.5)  exposure and white matter volumes in the total brain and multimodal association  areas (frontal, parietal, and temporal; all p for interaction <0.05), while the  associations with other brain regions were not modified. Consistent results were  found for dietary intakes of LCn3PUFAs and nonfried fish.

We studied the  longitudinal development of the HAI to identify aging trajectories and evaluated the  role of baseline sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors of the  trajectories. Four measurements with intervals of 5 years were included from the  Doetinchem Cohort Study. The HAI reflects levels of systolic blood pressure,  non-fasting plasma glucose levels, global cognitive functioning, plasma creatinine  levels and lung functioning. The HAI score ranges from 0 to 10: higher scores  indicate a better health profile. Latent class mixture modelling was used to model  within-person change and to identify aging trajectories. Area under the curve was  calculated per trajectory to estimate total healthy years. In total, 2324 women and  2013 men were included. One HAI trajectory was identified for women, and two  trajectories for men, labelled 'gradual' aging (76%) and 'early' aging (24%). Men  who were medium/high educated, below 36 years at baseline, complied with guidelines  on physical activity and were not obese in any round were associated with increased  odds to 'gradual' aging of 1.46 (CI: 1.18-1.81), 1.93 (CI: 1.42-2.62), 1.26  (1.02-1.57) and 1.76 (1.32-2.35), respectively. Between 30 and 70 years of age, men  in the 'early' aging trajectory had the least healthy years (29.6 years), followed  by women (30.1 years), and 'gradual' aging men (34.7 years). This study emphasizes  that 'physiological aging' is not only an issue of older ages. Between 30 and  70 years of age, 'early' aging men and women had approximately five healthy years  less compared to 'gradual' aging men. Lifestyle factors (e.g. nutrition and physical  activity) seem to play an important role in optimal aging.","2020-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:38:55","","106193","","","139","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Improving our understanding of the predictors of cognitive, physical and  psychosocial wellbeing among the oldest old can result in substantial benefits for  the individuals and for the society as a whole. The Cardiovascular Risk Factors,  Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) study investigated risk factors and determinants of  cognitive impairment in a population-based longitudinal cohort, which was first  examined between 1972 and 1992, when individuals were in their midlife, and  re-assessed in 1998 and 2005-2009. Most of the study participants are currently aged  85 years or older. We aim to re-examine the cohort's survivors and gain further  insights on the mechanisms underlying both cognitive and overall healthy ageing at  old age. METHODS: CAIDE85+ is the third follow-up of the CAIDE study participants.  All individuals still alive and living in the Kuopio and Joensuu areas of Eastern  Finland, from the original CAIDE cohort (two random samples, N = 2000 + ~ 900), will  be invited to a re-examination. The assessment includes self-reported data related  to basic demographics and lifestyle, as well as psychosocial and physical health  status. Cognitive and physical evaluations are also conducted. Blood biomarkers  relevant for dementia and ageing are assessed. Primary outcomes are the measurements  related to cognition and daily life functioning (CERAD, Trail Making Test-A,  Letter-Digit Substitution Test, Clinical Dementia Rating and Activities of Daily  Living). Secondary endpoints of the study are outcomes related to physical health  status, psychosocial wellbeing, as well as age-related health indicators.  DISCUSSION: Through a follow-up of more than 40 years, CAIDE85+ will provide  invaluable information on the risk and protective factors that contribute to  cognitive and physical health, as well as ageing and longevity.

Additionally, strain analysis across the entire cardiac  cycle facilitates a more detailed assessment of deformation, yet this has not been  implemented to characterize the ageing LV and in association with training status.  This study investigated healthy ageing and training status on LV systolic and  diastolic strain utilizing novel echocardiographic applications. METHODS: Forty  healthy males were included and allocated into four groups; young recreationally  active (Y(RA,) n = 9; 28 ± 5 years), old recreationally active (O(RA), n = 10;  68 ± 6), young trained (Y(T,) n = 10; 27 ± 6 years), and old trained (O(T), n = 11,  64 ± 4 years) groups. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography was  performed to ascertain peak LV longitudinal and circumferential strain (base and  apex) strain within each myocardial layer and at 5% increments across the cardiac  cycle. RESULTS: Older groups had lower diastolic longitudinal lengthening and  circumferential expansion between 40-85% mid-diastole, regardless of training status  (P < 0.05). Whereas, strain throughout systole was similar between groups  (P > 0.05). Longitudinal and circumferential (base and apex) peak and layer-specific  strain did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Novel applications of  diastolic strain revealed lower age-associated LV longitudinal lengthening and  circumferential expansion in older age. Yet, diastolic strain profiles did not  differ based on chronic habits of exercise training and, thus, older trained men did  not demonstrate an attenuation of age-associated differences in mid-diastolic LV  strain.","2020-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2059-2073","","9","120","","Eur J Appl Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32623518  PMCID: PMC7419356","","","","Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Heart Ventricles/*physiopathology; Ageing; Diastole/physiology; Echocardiography/methods; Mechanics; Rest/*physiology; Speckle-tracking echocardiography; Sports/*physiology; Systole/physiology; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/physiopathology; Ventricular Function, Left/*physiology; Ventricular strain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public health","","2468-2667","10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30114-6","","BACKGROUND: Retirement ages are rising in many countries to offset the challenges of population ageing, but people's capacity to work for more years in their later  working life (>50 years) is unclear. We aimed to estimate healthy working life  expectancy in England. METHODS: This analysis included adults aged 50 years and  older from six waves (2002-13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA),  with linked mortality data. Healthy working life expectancy was defined as the  average number of years expected to be spent healthy (no limiting long-standing  illness) and in paid work (employment or self-employment) from age 50 years. Healthy  working life expectancy was estimated for England overall and stratified by sex,  educational attainment, deprivation level, occupation type, and region by use of  interpolated Markov chain multi-state modelling. FINDINGS: There were 15 284  respondents (7025 men and 8259 women) with survey and mortality data for the study  period. Healthy working life expectancy at age 50 years was on average 9·42 years  (10·94 years [95% CI 10·65-11·23] for men and 8·25 years [7·92-8·58] for women) and  life expectancy was 31·76 years (30·05 years for men and 33·49 years for women). The  number of years expected to be spent unhealthy and in work from age 50 years was  1·84 years (95% CI 1·74-1·94) in England overall. Population subgroups with the  longest healthy working life expectancy were the self-employed (11·76 years [95% CI  10·76-12·76]) or those with non-manual occupations (10·32 years [9·95-10·69]), those  with a tertiary education (11·27 years [10·74-11·80]), those living in southern  England (10·73 years [10·16-11·30] in the South East and 10·51 years [9·80-11·22] in  the South West), and those living in the least deprived areas (10·53 years  [10·06-10·99]). INTERPRETATION: Healthy working life expectancy at age 50 years in  England is below the remaining years to State Pension age. Older workers of lower  socioeconomic status and in particular regions in England might benefit from  proactive approaches to improve health, workplace environments, and job  opportunities to improve their healthy working life expectancy. Continued monitoring  of healthy working life expectancy would provide further examination of the success  of such approaches and that of policies to extend working lives.

Public health","","2468-2667","10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30077-3","","BACKGROUND: The rapid growth of the size of the older population is having a substantial effect on health and social care services in many societies across the  world. Maintaining health and functioning in older age is a key public health issue  but few studies have examined factors associated with inequalities in trajectories  of health and functioning across countries. The aim of this study was to investigate  trajectories of healthy ageing in older men and women (aged ≥45 years) and the  effect of education and wealth on these trajectories. METHODS: This population-based  study is based on eight longitudinal cohorts from Australia, the USA, Japan, South  Korea, Mexico, and Europe harmonised by the EU Ageing Trajectories of Health:  Longitudinal Opportunities and Synergies (ATHLOS) consortium. We selected these  studies from the repository of 17 ageing studies in the ATHLOS consortium because  they reported at least three waves of collected data. We used multilevel modelling  to investigate the effect of education and wealth on trajectories of healthy ageing  scores, which incorporated 41 items of physical and cognitive functioning with a  range between 0 (poor) and 100 (good), after adjustment for age, sex, and cohort  study. FINDINGS: We used data from 141 214 participants, with a mean age of 62·9  years (SD 10·1) and an age range of 45-106 years, of whom 76 484 (54·2%) were women.  The earliest year of baseline data was 1992 and the most recent last follow-up year  was 2015. Education and wealth affected baseline scores of healthy ageing but had  little effect on the rate of decrease in healthy ageing score thereafter. Compared  with those with primary education or less, participants with tertiary education had  higher baseline scores (adjusted difference in score of 10·54 points, 95% CI  10·31-10·77). The adjusted difference in healthy ageing score between lowest and  highest quintiles of wealth was 8·98 points (95% CI 8·74-9·22). Among the eight  cohorts, the strongest inequality gradient for both education and wealth was found  in the Health Retirement Study from the USA. INTERPRETATION: The apparent difference  in baseline healthy ageing scores between those with high versus low education  levels and wealth suggests that cumulative disadvantage due to low education and  wealth might have largely deteriorated health conditions in early life stages,  leading to persistent differences throughout older age, but no further increase in  ageing disparity after age 70 years. Future research should adopt a lifecourse  approach to investigate mechanisms of health inequalities across education and  wealth in different societies.

METHODS: In this retrospective study,  performed on 417 participants, we analysed serum NfL and p-Tau(181) concentrations  with an ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) approach. We assessed the  diagnostic values of serum biomarkers in the differential diagnosis between FTLD,  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy ageing; their role as markers of disease  severity assessing the correlation with clinical variables, cross-sectional brain  imaging and neurophysiological data; their role as prognostic markers, considering  their ability to predict survival probability in FTLD. RESULTS: We observed  significantly higher levels of serum NfL in patients with FTLD syndromes, compared  with healthy controls, and lower levels of p-Tau(181) compared with patients with  AD. Serum NfL concentrations showed a high accuracy in discriminating between FTLD  and healthy controls (area under the curve (AUC): 0.86, p<0.001), while serum  p-Tau(181) showed high accuracy in differentiating FTLD from patients with AD (AUC:  0.93, p<0.001). In FTLD, serum NfL levels correlated with measures of cognitive  function, disease severity and behavioural disturbances and were associated with  frontotemporal atrophy and indirect measures of GABAergic deficit. Moreover, serum  NfL concentrations were identified as the best predictors of survival probability.  CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of serum NfL and p-Tau(181) may provide a comprehensive  view of FTLD, aiding in the differential diagnosis, in staging disease severity and  in defining survival probability.","2020-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","960-967","","9","91","","J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This study  measured energy and fat absorption in healthy, community-dwelling adults eating a  moderate-to-high fat American diet via stool- and serum-based methods. METHODS: This  was a secondary analysis of healthy subjects recruited as the comparison group in a  chronic pancreatitis study. Subjects recorded dietary intake and collected stool  over 3-day periods. Stool was analyzed for fat content using the coefficient of fat  absorption and for energy content using bomb calorimetry. The malabsorption blood  test (MBT) was used to measure dietary fat absorption. RESULTS: Nineteen subjects  had mean daily stool measures of 143 g wet weight, 4.1 g of fat, and 178 kcal. The  mean coefficients of fat and energy absorption were 96% and 93%, respectively. The  mean MBT area under the curve cut-point was greater than 8 mg·h/dL. CONCLUSIONS:  This study confirms the historical reference range for the coefficient of fat  absorption in contemporary healthy, community-dwelling adults on a moderate-to-high  fat diet. The study contributes to the development of reference range values for  multiple bomb calorimetry-based outcomes of stool energy losses and to the  serum-based MBT as a promising method for measuring fat absorption.","2020-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:35:56","","845-854","","6","49","","Pancreas","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32590620  PMCID: PMC8335406","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Adult; Cohort Studies; Independent Living/*statistics & numerical data; *Energy Intake; Calorimetry/methods; Dietary Fats/*metabolism; Feces/*chemistry; Healthy Aging/*metabolism; Intestinal Absorption; Pancreatitis, Chronic/diagnosis/*metabolism; Healthy Aging -- metabolism; Calorimetry -- methods; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fats -- metabolism; Feces -- chemistry; Independent Living -- statistics & numerical data; Pancreatitis, Chronic -- diagnosis; Pancreatitis, Chronic -- metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the  Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) data from the years 2002,  2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014, this article investigates whether there is a trend of  ""healthy aging"" in China. A second-order factor model including four dimensions of  physical health, functional status, mental health and social health was constructed  to measure a latent variable, ""Health_elders"". The further multigroup comparison  results by structural equation modeling showed that, with the exception of 2008, the  Health_elders in 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2014 displayed an upward trend, and the mean  differences in Health_elders across five periods were significant. These findings  indicate that on the whole, compared with older people in the past, older people in  more recent periods are healthier, which supports the trend of ""healthy aging"" in  China. In terms of cohorts, the average health levels of male, town-residing elderly  populations are higher, while the healthy aging trends among female, rural and urban  elderly populations are stronger. Moreover, the physical health levels of the 60-74  years-old cohort are decreasing, and the participation of elderly individuals in  social activities is low, which are the weaknesses in the healthy aging process in  China.","2020-06-17","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","12","17","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32560573  PMCID: PMC7345691","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Longevity; *Healthy Aging; China; *health; *Health Status; *latent variable; *structural equation modeling; *comprehensive assessment; *second-order factor model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These practices may contribute to poor long-term psychosocial health,  thereby interrupting processes of healthy aging. Few studies have examined  psychosocial differences between persons with and without prior experiences of  conversion therapy. We assessed associations between prior conversion therapy  experiences and psychosocial health among midlife and older men who have sex with  men (MSM; age 40+ years). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included a  multicity sample of MSM (N = 1,156) enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study  who completed health surveys (2016-2019) as part of their biannual study visits.  Using multivariable regressions, we investigated the associations of prior  conversion therapy with current depressive symptoms, internalized homophobia,  post-traumatic stress, and cumulative psychosocial conditions. Using a trait-level  measure (e.g., life purpose and perseverance), we tested whether resilience  moderated these associations. RESULTS: The full sample was predominantly  non-Hispanic white with a mean age of 62.6 years. Fifteen percent of men (n =  171/1,156) reported prior conversion therapy. In multivariable models, men exposed  to conversion therapy were more likely to have depressive symptoms and above-average  internalized homophobia. Men exposed to conversion therapy had 2-2.5 times the odds  of reporting 1 and ≥2 psychosocial conditions, respectively, compared with those who  reported 0 conditions. Resilience did not moderate these associations. DISCUSSION  AND IMPLICATIONS: Conversion therapies are nonaffirming social stressors for MSM and  may compromise critical psychosocial aspects of healthy aging among MSM.","2020-09-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:41:44","","1291-1302","","7","60","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

This is due to standard two-dimensional imaging techniques being unreliable.  Four-dimensional flow (4D flow) derived right ventricular blood flow kinetic energy  assessment could circumvent the issues of the current imaging modalities. It also  remains unknown whether there is an association between right ventricular blood flow  kinetic energy (KE) and healthy ageing. We hypothesise that healthy ageing requires  maintaining normal RV intra-cavity blood flow as quantified using KE method. The  main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of healthy ageing on  tricuspid through-plane flow and right ventricular blood flow kinetic energy. In  this study, fifty-three healthy participants received a 4D flow cardiovascular  magnetic resonance (CMR) scan on 1.5 T Philips Ingenia. Cine segmentation and 4D  flow analysis were performed using dedicated software. Standard statistical methods  were carried out to investigate the associations. Both RV E-wave KEi(EDV) (r = -0.3,  P = 0.04) and A-wave KEi(EDV) (r = 0.42, P < 0.01) showed an association with  healthy ageing. Additionally, the right ventricular blood flow KEi(EDV) E/A ratio  demonstrated the strongest association with healthy ageing (r = -0.53, P < 0.01)  when compared to all RV functional and haemodynamic parameters. Furthermore, in a  multivariate regression model, KEi(EDV) E/A ratio and 4D flow derived tricuspid  valve stroke volume demonstrated independent association to healthy ageing (beta  -0.02 and 0.68 respectively, P < 0.01). Ageing is independently associated with 4D  flow derived tricuspid stroke volume and RV blood flow KE E/A ratio. These novel 4D  flow CMR derived imaging markers have future potential for RV diastolic assessment.","2020-06-18","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9908","","1","10","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32555252  PMCID: PMC7303161","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; *Blood Flow Velocity; *Stroke Volume; Hemodynamics; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine/*methods; Observer Variation; Tricuspid Valve/*physiology; Ventricular Dysfunction, Right/*physiopathology; Ventricular Function, Right/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Amyloid-β 1 to 42 (Aβ(42) ), total tau (t-tau) and  phosphorylated tau (p-tau) at the threonine 181 position were measured using the  high-precision Roche Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in all available  CSF samples from longitudinally studied patients with PD (n = 416) and HCs (n = 192)  followed for up to 3 years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).  Longitudinal CSF and clinical data were analyzed with linear-mixed effects models.  RESULTS: We found patients with PD had lower CSF t-tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL; range  = 80.9-467.0); p-tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL; range = 8.0-40.1), and Aβ(42) (median =  846.2 pg/mL; range = 238.8-3,707.0) than HCs at baseline (CSF t-tau median = 173.5  pg/mL; range = 82.0-580.8; p-tau median = 15.4 pg/mL; range = 8.1-73.6; and Aβ(42)  median = 926.5 pg/mL; range = 239.1-3,297.0; p < 0.05-0.001) and a  moderate-to-strong correlation among these biomarkers in both patients with PD and  HCs (Rho = 0.50-0.97; p < 0.001). Of the patients with PD, 31.5% had pathologically  low levels of CSF Aβ(42) at baseline and these patients with PD had lower p-tau  levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL; range = 8.0-32.8) compared with 27.7% of HCs with  pathologically low CSF Aβ(42) (CSF p-tau median = 12.8 pg/mL; range 8.2-73.6; p  < 0.03)(.)

Baseline CSF Aβ(42)  values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic, and motor  function in early PD. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers  may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers,  although modest over a 3-year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate  from healthy aging.

However, studies regarding the effect of tau on longitudinal  cortical thinning, particularly in healthy aging and preclinical AD, have been  limited in number due to the relatively recent introduction of in vivo PET tracers  for imaging tau pathology. Here, we investigate [18F]-flortaucipir (FTP, a marker of  paired helical filament tau) PET as a predictor of atrophy in healthy aging and  preclinical AD. We examine longitudinal structural MRI brain imaging data,  retrospectively and prospectively relative to FTP imaging, using piecewise linear  mixed-effect models with time centered at each participant's FTP-PET session.  Participants include 111 individuals from the Harvard Aging Brain Study who  underwent at least three MRI sessions over an average of 4.46 years and one FTP-PET  at the approximate midpoint of the observation period. Our primary analyses focus on  inferior temporal (IT) FTP standardized uptake value ratios and longitudinal  FreeSurfer defined cortical regions of interest. Relationships were also explored  using other regional FTP measures (entorhinal, composite, and local), within high  and low Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET groups, and with longitudinal subcortical  volume. Strong associations between IT FTP and cortical thinning were found, most  notably in temporal, midline, and prefrontal regions, with stronger effects  generally observed in the prospective as compared to retrospective time frame.  Significant differences between prospective and retrospective rates of thinning were  found in the inferior and middle temporal gyri, cingulate areas, as well as pars  orbitalis such that higher IT FTP was associated with greater prospective rates of  thinning. Within the high PiB group, significant differences between prospective and  retrospective rates of thinning were similarly observed. However, no consistent  pattern of tau-related change in cortical thickness within the low PiB group was  discerned. These results provide support for the hypothesis that tau pathology is a  driver of future atrophy as well as provide additional evidence for tau-PET as an  effective AD biomarker for interventional clinical trials.","2020-10-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","116991","","","220","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

From this standpoint, limitations in individual's functioning (beyond the mere absence of disease) may drastically impact on how well people becoming older. This study aimed to identify functional status profiles in a nationally representative sample of older adults, using latent class analysis methods. Moreover, it intended to study the how identified classes would be related to health-related outcomes later in life, as a way to provide some evidence on predictive validity. Data from a nationally representative sample of Spanish older adults (N = 2,118; 56.18% women; M = 71.50 years, SD = 7.76), were used. Profiles were identified according to a large set of functioning indicators from multiple domains using latent class analysis. Outcomes were studied over a 3-year follow-up, considering both the individual (quality of life, well-being and mortality) and institutional level (health service utilisation). As a result, seven profiles were identified: normative profile (showed by most participants), limited cognitive functioning class, limited global functioning class, limited mental and mobility functioning class, poor self-reported health class, limited sensory functioning class and limited objective functioning class. All the profiles with limitations across domains showed poor outcomes. Multidimensional limitations were related to the worst outcomes, especially when psychosomatic complaints and high feelings of loneliness were reported. To sum up, latent class analysis constitutes a suitable alternative to study population heterogeneity, providing relevant evidence to help making decision in public and community health.","2020-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:59:51","","2190-2198","","6","28","","Health Soc Care Community","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32501615","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Self Report; *well-being; Latent Class Analysis; *Functioning profile; *health service utilisation; *latent class analysis; *mortality risk; *quality of life; Health Services; Healthy Aging/*physiology/*psychology; Loneliness; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Physical Functional Performance; quality of life; well-being; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Functioning profile; health service utilisation; Healthy Aging -- psychology; latent class analysis; mortality risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No previous study has examined  centenarians free of common chronic diseases amongst New Zealand centenarians.  METHODS: Retrospective observational cross-sectional review of a national dataset  determining the prevalence of depression, dementia, diabetes and hypertension,  smoking, physical activity and social relationships among older adults (aged  60-99 years) and centenarians. Participants were all older New Zealanders living  independently in the community who completed the international Residential  Assessment Instrument-Home Care (interRAI-HC) assessment during the study's 5-year  period (July 2013-June 2018). RESULTS: The assessments of 292 centenarians (mean age  101.03, SD 1.27 years) and 103,377 elderly (mean age 81.7, SD 5.7 years) were  analysed. Compared to the elderly, centenarians were more likely to be female  (74.7%, compared with 59.3% elderly, p < 0.001). Centenarians free of common chronic  diseases did not differ from other centenarians on any of the analysed variables.  Reduction in smoking rates and steady high rates of social engagement were  associated with reaching a centenarian status free of common chronic diseases  compared with older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Not smoking and being socially engaged  throughout older age were associated with being a centenarian free of common chronic  diseases. This study adds to our understanding the complexities of attaining  exceptional longevity.","2021-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","513-520","","3","33","","Aging Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 32488471","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longevity; Smoking; *Aging; Retrospective Studies; Centenarians; *Longevity; Ageing; Escapers; InterRAI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the factors of importance for physical activity in  older adults are therefore essential. Informed by animal and human data linking the  dopamine system to motivation and reward processes, we investigated the associations  between variations in dopamine genes and objectively measured physical activity and  sedentary behaviour. Further, we aimed to verify whether higher age may exacerbate  the impact of dopamine genes on physical activity. METHODS: We analyzed data from  504 older adults, 66-87 years, from the population-based Swedish National study on  Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). Physical activity was measured with activPAL  accelerometers and DNA was extracted from blood samples for genotyping. We assessed  the effects of three dopamine relevant genetic variations (DRD1, DRD2, and DRD3) on  daily time in sedentary behavior, light-intensity physical activity and  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity using analyses of covariance, adjusting for  sex, age and physical function. RESULTS: Higher dopamine receptor efficacy was  related to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but not to light-intensity  physical activity or sedentary time. DRD1 explained 2.7% of variance in  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with more pronounced effect in people aged  ≥80 years, about 10% of explained variance. CONCLUSION: Stronger genetic effects in  older adults are in line with the well-established nonlinear effects of dopamine  signaling on performance, expected to be exacerbated with aging. Individuals over  80 years, genetically predisposed to lower dopamine receptor efficacy, engaged on  average 100 min/week in moderate-to-high physical activity, below the recommended  levels beneficial for healthy aging. Our findings highlight that some individuals  might need extra support to maintain a physically active lifestyle.","2020-05-24","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:17:19","","68","","1","17","","Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32448293  PMCID: PMC7245799","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Exercise -- physiology; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Aging -- genetics; *Aging; *Physical activity; Exercise/*physiology; Sweden; *Accelerometery; *Aging/genetics/physiology; *Dopamine; *Genes; *Sedentary behaviour; Receptors, Dopamine/*genetics; Sedentary Behavior; Physical activity; Accelerometery; Dopamine; Genes; Receptors, Dopamine; Receptors, Dopamine -- genetics; Sedentary behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The value of SCD as a proxy marker, however, depends on the  consistency of associations between subjective and objective cognitive measures  across sociodemographic and psychological factors. METHODS: We evaluated baseline  data from the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) study  (n=1615). SCD was measured using the 12-item Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale. Using  linear regression models with interaction terms, we evaluated 6 potential modifiers  (age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, family history of dementia, and  depressive symptoms) of the association between cognitive performance (episodic  memory, executive function) and SCD. RESULTS: Lower episodic memory and executive  function scores were associated with higher log(ECog scores) (more SCD). Older age  and elevated depressive symptoms were associated with higher log(ECog scores). Age  (interaction P=0.002) and education (interaction P=0.01) modified the association  between executive function and log(ECog scores). Specifically, associations between  executive function and log(ECog scores) were stronger among participants with more  education and less pronounced among older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The association  between cognitive performance and log(ECog scores) differed little across  sociodemographic and psychological factors.

METHODS: A total of 3657  community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 years from Nanchang city were recruited in this  study. A 3-year follow-up test was carried out for all the participants to determine  whether they turn to non-SA. Developed questionnaires and physical fitness tests  were used to obtain overall health condition, balance, agility, speed, reactions and  gait. Four machine learning models (logistic regression, deep learning, random  forest and gradient boosting decision tree) were applied to develop the prediction  models, the analyzed sample was 890. RESULTS: The baseline prevalence of successful  aging was 26.99%, The average annual incidence rate of SA to non-SA was 11.04%.  There were significant differences between the SA and non-SA groups for all physical  fitness tests at baseline. The accuracy and area under the curve of all four machine  learning models was >85%, the positive predictive value and sensitivity was >75%,  and the specificity was >86% on the average.

Linear fixed effects regressions were used. RESULTS:  Adjusting for socioeconomics and various health-related covariates, regressions  showed that decreases in cognitive functioning were associated with decreases in  satisfaction with aging (β = .002, p = .02). Furthermore, regressions showed that  decreases in satisfaction with aging were associated with increases in age (β=-.01,  p < .001), decreases in physical functioning (β = .002, p < .01), worsening  self-rated health (β=-.12, p < .001) and they were inversely associated with changes  from employment to retirement (β = .11, p < .001).

This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of functional  capacity over a 25-year period and to explore socioeconomic differences in  trajectory-group membership probabilities, using a national sample of older  Japanese. DESIGN: Longitudinal panel study with 8 observation points from 1987  to 2012. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The data came from the National Survey of the  Japanese Elderly, which consisted of 6193 samples of community-dwelling Japanese  aged 60 years and older at baseline. METHODS: Functional capacity measure included  basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Group-based mixture models were  used for data analysis. RESULTS: Among participants aged 60 to 74 years at baseline,  4 trajectories were identified: minimal disability (80.3%), late-onset disability  (11.6%), early-onset disability (6.2%), and moderate disability (1.9%). Those aged  ≥75 years at baseline experienced higher levels of disability but somewhat parallel  trajectories, including minimal disability (73.3%), early-onset disability (11.2%),  moderate disability (11.3%), and severe and worsening disability (4.2%). Lower  socioeconomic status, including education and household income, was associated with  a higher risk of experiencing trajectories of poorer functional capacity among those  aged 60 to 74 years, but no such association existed among those aged ≥75 years.  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found that approximately 70% to 80% of older  Japanese maintained healthy functional capacity over time. Although we could not  follow those who dropped out during the observation period, this study provided  useful evidence that socioeconomic disparities in functional health converge with  age. Our findings inform the design of health policies and interventions aiming to  maintain functional health among older adults with diverse socioeconomic  backgrounds. In particular, public policies aiming to reduce socioeconomic  disparities should be emphasized to promote healthy aging.","2020-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:55:07","","734-739.e1","","6","21","","J Am Med Dir Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020.

Is there something special about  their brain functional connectivity that helps them preserve cognitive function into  the 11th decade of life? In a cohort of 57 dementia-free near-centenarians and  centenarians (95-103 years old) and 66 cognitively unimpaired younger participants  (76-79 years old), we aimed to investigate brain functional characteristics in the  extreme age range using resting-state functional MRI. Using group-level independent  component analysis and dual regression, results showed group differences in the  functional connectivity of seven group-level independent component (IC) templates,  after accounting for sex, education years, and grey matter volume, and correcting  for multiple testing at family-wise error rate of 0.05. After Bonferroni correction  for testing 30 IC templates, near-centenarians and centenarians showed stronger  functional connectivity between right frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and left  inferior frontal gyrus (Bonferroni-corrected p ​= ​0.024), a core region of the left  FPCN. The investigation of between-IC functional connectivity confirmed the  voxel-wise result by showing stronger functional connectivity between bilateral  FPCNs in near-centenarians and centenarians compared to young-old controls. In  addition, near-centenarians and centenarians had weaker functional connectivity  between default mode network and fronto-temporo-parietal network compared to  young-old controls. In near-centenarians and centenarians, stronger functional  connectivity between bilateral FPCNs was associated with better cognitive  performance in the visuospatial domain. The current study highlights the key role of  bilateral FPCN connectivity in the reserve capacity against age-related cognitive  decline.","2020-07-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","116855","","","215","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Only recently is it possible to study the factors that portend  survival to this age. METHODS: Among participants of the Cardiovascular Health  Study, we studied the association of repeated measures of cardiovascular risk  factors measured over 15-23 years of follow-up and not only survival to 90 years of  age, but also healthy aging outcomes among the population who reached age 90. We  included participants aged 67-75 years at baseline (n = 3,613/5,888) to control for  birth cohort effects, and followed participants until death or age 90 (median  follow-up = 14.7 years). RESULTS: Higher systolic blood pressure was associated with  a lower likelihood of survival to age 90, although this association was attenuated  at older ages (p-value for interaction <.001) and crossed the null for measurements  taken in participants' 80's. Higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)  cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI)  were associated with greater longevity. Among the survivors to age 90, those with  worse cardiovascular profile (high blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, glucose, and  BMI; low HDL cholesterol) had lower likelihood of remaining free of cardiovascular  disease, cognitive impairment, and disability. CONCLUSION: In summary, we observed  paradoxical associations between some cardiovascular risk factors and survival to  old age; whereas, among those who survive to very old age, these risk factors were  associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes.","2020-10-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2207-2214","","11","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

We aimed to examine to what extent social support mediates the  association between SEP and overall QoL among older adults (aged 60-84 years). We  studied a population-based cohort of 585 noninstitutionalized adults in Porto,  Portugal, who were evaluated in 2009. Education, occupation, and perceived income  adequacy were used as SEP indicators. The WHOQOL-OLD was used to determine overall  QoL. Social support was assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived  Social Support. Path analysis was conducted to quantify direct, indirect, and total  effects of SEP on QoL. There was a positive total effect of education on QoL  (β = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.05-0.48). In this model, we found an indirect effect through  social support (β = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05-0.26), explaining 54% of the pathway between  education and QoL. A similar pattern was identified for the association between  occupation and QoL. Perceived income adequacy had a total effect of 2.74 (95% CI:  1.68-3.93) on QoL. Although an indirect effect through social support was found  (β = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.42-1.55), a direct effect from this variable remained  (β = 1.76; 95% CI: 0.65-2.90). Social support can be a mechanism through which SEP  impacts the QoL of older people. Strengthening social support ties may attenuate the  impact of social inequalities and improve the QoL of this population.","2020-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:54:56","","106073","","","135","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: In this study, longitudinal data with n = 7,062  observations from 2014 (wave 5) to 2017 (wave 6) were taken from the German Ageing  Survey (representative sample of middle aged and older individuals residing in  private households). The five-item Attitudes Toward Own Ageing subscale of the  Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) was used to quantify  self-perceptions of ageing. The frequency of GP visits in the past 12 months served  as outcome measure (first model: measured continuously; second model: top 10% were  defined as frequent attenders). To exploit the features of panel data, and to  mitigate the problem of unobserved heterogeneity, fixed effects regressions were  used. RESULTS: Adjusting for predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and  need-factors, regressions showed that an increase in self-perceptions of ageing was  associated with decreases in the number of GP visits (IRR= .83 (95% CI: .77-.91)),  and a decreased likelihood of becoming a frequent attender (OR= .44 (95% CI:  .29-.66)). CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a longitudinal study and exploiting the  longitudinal data structure, the current study adds to our current knowledge by  demonstrating that self-perceptions of ageing contribute to the frequency of GP  visits as well as frequent attendance. Since self-perceptions of ageing are  modifiable, this may help to manage health care use.","2021-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1493-1498","","8","25","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32189524","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Aging; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; *healthy aging; *aging satisfaction; *frequent attendance; *general practitioner visits; *General Practitioners; *health services for the aged; *Primary health care; *self-perceptions of ageing; Self Concept","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most common  themes for all the ethno-cultural groups were ""lifestyle"", ""physical activity"", and  ""attitude""; other themes varied by ethno-cultural background. These findings  demonstrate that older Canadians from various ethno-cultural backgrounds define  healthy aging differently. These variations must be taken into consideration for  developing culturally sensitive programs to promote healthy aging among all  Canadians. Theorizing on healthy (or 'successful') aging must envision it as a  subjective and multidimensional concept.","2020-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:56:34","","100834","","","52","","J Aging Stud","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It is important to understand the relationship, if any, of modifiable factors such as diet on healthy aging. However, there are few studies of diet among healthy oldest old, especially in North American populations. We aimed to characterize dietary patterns among 'super-seniors' (SS) within the Canadian Healthy Aging Study.Methods: 122 SS aged 85 years or older and free of cancer, cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, dementia and diabetes were recruited. Comparisons were made to 12,626 participants aged 65-86 in the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging who completed the same 36-item food frequency questionnaire that queried consumption over the prior 12 months of nutrients and foods thought to be important for aging. Dietary patterns were identified with principal component analysis. The odds of being a SS were determined for quartiles of each dietary pattern with logistic regression.Results: Two dietary patterns were identified; a western diet characterized by french fries, red meat, processed meat and a nutrient-rich diet which included fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds among other healthy food choices. Higher scores for both dietary patterns were associated with increased odds of being a SS, however, only the western dietary pattern remained associated with adjustment for covariates (Quartile 4: OR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.91-5.51).Conclusions: Our finding adds to the limited evidence on dietary intake among the healthiest oldest old but it is unclear whether assocations reflect generational differences between groups or possible contributions to longevity.","2020-03-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:43:51","","106","","1","20","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32178631  PMCID: PMC7077120","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aging; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Feeding Behavior; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Healthy Aging; *Aging; *Diet; Centenarians; Healthy Aging; *Longevity; Canada; *Centenarians; *Nutrition; Diet, Western; Nutrition; Questionnaires; Eating Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used generalized estimating equations to examine trajectories and determinants of healthy ageing by level of education among 17,591 adults followed over a 14-year period. Educational level was categorized as less than a high school diploma, high school diploma, some college education, and a college or higher degree. Potential determinants included demographic factors, early-life characteristics (childhood health and childhood poverty), health-related factors (health behaviours, physical and mental health conditions), and psychosocial characteristics (perceived neighbourhood safety, volunteerism, and work status).Main Outcome Measures: Informed by earlier work, we defined healthy ageing as freedom from cognitive impairment, freedom from disability, and high physical functioning.Results: The log odds of healthy ageing declined over time in all educational groups. Importantly, the decline was smaller in adults with a college or higher degree than in those without a high school diploma. Age, gender, wealth, health behaviours, productive engagement, depressive symptoms, and the presence of chronic conditions predicted healthy ageing across the educational spectrum; however, the impact of several factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, childhood poverty, and volunteerism) varied by educational level.Conclusions: Education shapes trajectories of healthy ageing in the United States. Similarities and differences in determinants of healthy ageing are evident across levels of education.

The SF-12 mental health score (MCS) showed a slight positive association with age and this effect remained stable after controlling for various age-related covariates. The SF-12 physical health score (PCS), in turn, was negatively associated with age. Age differences in PCS were fully explained by age decrements in objective physical health. However, consistent with the so-called paradox of aging, the association between objective and subjective physical health weakened with age.Conclusion: These findings add to prior evidence indicating that - in spite of objective health decrements - subjective HRQoL is maintained in later life among Asian Chinese. Also, these paradoxical patterns appear to vary for mental and physical components of HRQoL, and future research is needed to explore the underlying mechanism.Trial Registration: Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on January 24, 2016 with trial registration number NCT02677831.","2020-03-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:36:04","","91","","1","20","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32138691  PMCID: PMC7057585","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Scales; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Healthy Aging; Healthy Aging; Taiwan; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; *Quality of Life; *Mental health score; *Objective physical health, subjective physical health; *Physical health score; Aging/*physiology/*psychology; Hand Strength; Taiwan/epidemiology; Mental health score; Objective physical health, subjective physical health; Physical health score; Taiwan -- epidemiology; Middle Age; Asians; Grip Strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/glaa057","","BACKGROUND: A critical step toward successful aging is to identify opportunities for prevention of functional decline. Our aim was to describe the heterogeneity in  trajectories of dependency preceding death in elders and to identify factors  associated with this heterogeneity. METHODS: The study relied on 3,238 participants  of the prospective population-based PAQUID cohort aged 65+ at baseline in 1988.  Dependency was defined from an 11-item scale of basic and instrumental activities of  daily living (ADL: bathing, dressing, toileting, continence, eating, and  transferring; instrumental activities of daily living (IADL): telephoning, shopping,  using transport, handling medication, and managing finances) collected over 22  years. Heterogeneous trajectories were estimated using a longitudinal item response  theory model including latent classes. RESULTS: Five distinct profiles of functional  dependency were identified over the two last decades of life: persistently high  (12%), moderate (26%), persistently low (40%), and accelerated high dependency  (15%), and no dependency (8%). Main factors associated with heterogeneity included  age at death, sex, education, initial cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination  [MMSE] score and dementia), initial disability, and poly-medication. CONCLUSIONS: In  the two last decades of life, more than 9 elders in 10 were characterized as  functional decliners. On average, around half of the elders died with no or mild  dependency, while 27% live several years with a high level of limitations and would  need assistance in activities of daily living, at least for 2-4 years preceding  death. The identified factors associated with these trajectories are important to  understand functional heterogeneity in elders and to propose interventions to  postpone or prevent ""chronic"" disability.","2020-11-13","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2396-2403","","12","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

The aim of the present study was to investigate (i) the association of adherence to  Med-Diet with depressive symptoms and multimorbidity in a cohort of geriatric  medical outpatients, and (ii) the role of Med-Diet in mediating the association  between depressive symptoms and multimorbidity. METHODS: A total of 143 geriatric  patients (mean age: 73.1 ± 8.35) were included. Adherence to Med-Diet was evaluated  using a validated 14-item questionnaire; depressive and cognitive symptoms were  assessed through the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Mini Mental State  Examination (MMSE) respectively; multimorbidity was evaluated using the Cumulative  Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRSG-SI). RESULTS: Significant associations  were found between MDQ score, GDS and CIRSG-SI (MDQ score and GDS: r= -0.206, p =  0.014; MDQ score and CIRSG-SI: r= -0.247, p = 0.003; GDS and CIRSG-SI: r = 0.251; p  = 0.003). These associations remained significant after adjusting for potential  confounding factors. A mediational model analysis showed that the direct effect of  CIRSG-SI on GDS was significant (b = 1.330; se = 0.59; p = 0.028) with this effect  being counterbalanced by higher MDQ scores (indirect effect of CIRS-G on GDS through  MDQ: b = 0.382; se = 0.19; p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: These findings (i) add to the  accumulating evidence that Med-Diet may have a positive impact on mental health in  the elderly, and (ii) suggest that Med-Diet may contribute, at least in part, to  protect geriatric patients with multimorbidity from the development of depressive  symptoms, ultimately promoting healthy aging.","2020-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:20:27","","104022","","","88","","Arch Gerontol Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We  characterized the ratio of within-network and between-network correlations via the  well-established segregation index. Our findings showed a decrease over a 4-year  interval in the functional segregation of the default mode, frontoparietal control  and salience ventral attention networks. In contrast, we showed an increase in the  segregation of the limbic network over the same interval. More importantly, the rate  of change in functional segregation of the frontoparietal control network was  associated with the rate of change in processing speed. These findings support the  hypothesis of functional dedifferentiation in healthy aging as well as its role in  cognitive function in elderly.","2020-07-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","116680","","","214","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

They shorten every time the cell replicates, and shorter telomeres have been associated  with increasing age and with many health behaviours. There is inconclusive evidence  on the association between physical activity (PA) and telomere length. OBJECTIVES:  To examine how leisure-time PA (LTPA) is associated with telomere length and  telomere attrition during 10 years of follow-up in elderly people. DESIGN: This  study is a 10-year prospective follow-up study. METHOD: For this prospective study,  we examined 1,014 subjects (mean age at baseline 60.8 years) from the Helsinki Birth  Cohort Study (HBCS). Relative leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was measured with a  quantitative real-time PCR and LTPA with a validated questionnaire. Multiple linear  regression analyses were used to assess the association between sex-specific LTPA  quartiles and LTL at baseline and change in LTL over 10 years. The analyses were  adjusted for age, educational attainment, smoking, body fat percentage, oestrogen  exposure in women and for follow-up time when applicable. RESULTS: At baseline,  volume of LTPA was not associated with LTL in men (p = 0.66) or in women (p = 0.33).  Among women, however, higher volume of LTPA at baseline was associated with greater  shortening of LTL (p for linearity 0.040) during the 10-year follow-up. No  association was found among men (p for linearity 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings  suggest that PA has a sex-specific role in regulation of telomere length in the  aging process as in our study a high volume of LTPA in elderly women, but not in  men, was associated with more rapid telomere attrition.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:20:59","","315-322","","4","66","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 S.

However, it has not been conveniently  addressed so far the role of SES on the incidence of mild cognitive impairment  (MCI). This study examines the impact of individual and neighbourhood dimensions of  SES, as well as their interaction, on the risk of developing MCI in a sample of  older adults.Method: Data from the Vallecas Project cohort, an ongoing  community-based longitudinal study for early detection of cognitive impairment and  dementia, were used to build two indices of SES namely individual and neighbourhood,  as well as a global SES as a combination of both, and to investigate their effects  on MCI conversion by means of a multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard  model.Results: A total of 1180 participants aged 70 years and older were enrolled in  this study. Of these, 199 cases of MCI (16.9%) were diagnosed at any point of the  follow-up. The individual and neighbourhood dimensions of SES played different roles  in the dynamics of the MCI occurrence through aging. Most importantly, the risk of  developing MCI was almost double for lower SES quartiles when compared to the  highest one.Conclusion: The incidence of MCI in older adults was related to both  individual characteristics and socioeconomic context. Public health strategies  should be holistic and focus not only on promoting the classical individual  preventive measures, but also on reducing social inequalities to foster healthy  aging and reduce dementia burden.","2021-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","814-823","","5","25","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 32067489","","","","Aged; Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prevalence; Social Class; *Aging; *Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology; *dementia; Disease Progression; *socioeconomic status; *mild cognitive impairment; *neighbourhood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although physical fitness is widely recognized to decline with age, age-related decreases in the  individual dimensions of physical fitness in later life are less clear. Purpose: The  purpose of the present study was to describe the age-related changes in six fitness  components covering a variety of motor dimensions in men and women through a 12-year  longitudinal epidemiological study. Method: Participants were randomly selected  community-living men (n = 1,139) and women (n = 1,128) aged 40 to 79 years at  baseline who were repeatedly tested over a mean (standard deviation) follow-up  period of 9.8 (3.4) years with a mean of 4.9 (2.3) examinations. The six physical  fitness tests were sit-and-reach, grip strength, sit-ups, one-leg standing, reaction  time and leg extension power. The effect of age on each physical fitness task was  analyzed using a mixed-effects model controlling for habitual physical activity  level. Results: The fixed effect of the interaction of age and time in all fitness  tests was significant in men. Higher age at baseline was significantly associated  with a greater decrease over time except in one-leg standing. In women, no  significant interaction effect of age and time was found in grip strength or  reaction time. Age-related changes in grip strength and reaction time were constant  with increasing age. Conclusion: Twelve-year longitudinal data showed that the  age-related decrease in physical fitness over time, especially musculoskeletal  fitness in men, was pronounced, whereas in women, the decrease was less pronounced.","2020-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","662-675","","4","91","","Res Q Exerc Sport","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 32053478","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Japan; Longitudinal Studies; Postural Balance; Reaction Time; Independent Living; Exercise/physiology; Aging/*physiology; Physical Fitness/*physiology; Hand Strength; Exercise Test/methods; late adulthood; Leg/physiology; Muscle Strength/physiology; physical performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of multiple physical performance  measures over 9 years in individuals aged 60-70 years and to evaluate their  characteristics and the overlap between measures. METHODS: Four physical performance  measures were assessed in 440 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study  Amsterdam: tandem stand, gait speed, chair stand, and handgrip strength.  Gender-specific latent class models were conducted to obtain distinct trajectories  and their degree of overlap. RESULTS: Mean age at baseline was 67.9 (SD 1.7) years  for males and 68.0 (SD 1.7) years for females. The optimal number of trajectories  differed across measures. For tandem stand, no distinct trajectories were found (all  179 males, 198 females). For gait speed, three trajectories were identified,  dependent on baseline speed: high-stable (47 males, 27 females), intermediate-stable  (132 males, 130 females), and low-declining performance (6 males, 48 females). Two  trajectories were identified for the chair stand: a stable (168 males, 150 females)  and declining trajectory (10 males, 38 females). For handgrip strength, three  declining trajectories were identified differing in baseline performance: high (55  males, 75 females), intermediate (111 males, 118 females), and low (17 males, 10  females). Overall, 11.9% of males and 5.7% of females were classified in similar  trajectories across measures. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of physical performance were  heterogeneous, but showed similar patterns for males and females. Little overlap  between measures was shown, suggesting different mechanisms for decline. This study  emphasizes the use of multiple domains to assess physical performance.","2020-09-25","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1951-1959","","10","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2020.

OBJECTIVE: To examine  the independent contributions of physical (PA) versus cognitive (CA) leisure  activities to brain and cognitive aging. METHODS: Independent samples of  non-demented older adults from University of California, San Francisco Hillblom  Aging Network (UCSF; n = 344 typically aging) and University of California, Davis  Diversity cohort (UCD; n = 485 normal to MCI) completed: 1) self-reported engagement  in current PA and CA (UCSF: Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly and Cognitive  Activity Scale; UCD: Life Experiences Assessment Form); 2) neuropsychological  batteries; and 3) neuroimaging total gray matter volume, white matter  hyperintensities, and/or global fractional anisotropy. PA and CA were simultaneously  entered into multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for demographic  characteristics and functional impairment severity. RESULTS: Brain outcomes: In  UCSF, only PA was positively associated with gray matter volume and attenuated the  relationship between age and fractional anisotropy. In UCD, only CA was associated  with less white matter hyperintensities and attenuated the relationship between age  and gray matter volume. Cognitive outcomes: In both cohorts, greater CA, but not PA,  related to better cognition, independent of age and brain structure. In UCSF, CA  attenuated the relationship between fractional anisotropy and cognition. In UCD, PA  attenuated the association between white matter hyperintensities and cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Although their specificity was not easily teased apart, both PA and CA  are clearly related to better brain and cognitive resilience markers across cohorts  with differing educational, racial, and disease statuses. PA and CA may  independently contribute to converging neuroprotective pathways for brain and  cognitive aging.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:44:30","","363-376","","1","74","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32039854  PMCID: PMC7233450","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Exercise -- physiology; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Healthy Aging; Cognition/*physiology; Resilience, Psychological; Exercise/*physiology; *Life Style; *Brain aging; *cognitive aging; *exercise; *mental stimulation; *reserve; *Resilience, Psychological; Anisotropy; Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Gray Matter/diagnostic imaging; White Matter/diagnostic imaging; Brain aging; Cognitive Dysfunction -- psychology; cognitive aging; exercise; Gray Matter -- diagnostic imaging; mental stimulation; reserve; White Matter -- diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While  these measures have strong predictive validity for adverse outcomes, they are  limited to assessing what older adults do in standardized settings, rather than what  they do in their daily life. Life-space mobility, which is the ability to move  within environments that expand from one's home to the greater community, has been  proposed as a more comprehensive measure of mobility. The aim of this study was to  determine the association between modifiable factors and life-space mobility in  older adults enrolled in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). METHODS:  Life-space mobility was measured using the Life Space Index (LSI). Explanatory  factors included physical, psychosocial and cognitive determinants, as well as pain,  fatigue, driving status, nutrition, body mass index, smoking status, and vision. To  estimate the association between the LSI and explanatory variables, univariate and  multivariable ordinary least squares regression analyses were performed. RESULTS:  All adults 65 years and older (n = 12,646) were included in the analysis. Fifty  percent were women and the mean age was 73.0 (SD5.7). The mean LSI score was 80.5,  indicating that, on average, the sample was able to move outside of their  neighborhood independently. All explanatory variables were significantly associated  with the LSI except for balance and memory. The top 3 variables that explained the  most variation in the LSI were driving, social support and walking speed.  CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine the association  between life-space mobility and a comprehensive set of modifiable factors that were  selected based on a theoretical framework and existing research evidence. This study  had two important messages. First, driving, social support and walking speed emerged  as the most significant correlates of life-space mobility in older adults. Second,  life-space mobility is multifactorial and interventions that are pragmatic in their  design and testing are needed that consider the complexity involved. A  multi-disciplinary approach to examining life-space mobility in older adults is  needed to optimize opportunities for healthy aging and develop strategies that  support mobility in older adulthood.","2020-01-31","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","35","","1","20","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 32005107  PMCID: PMC6995110","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; *Independent Living; *Older adults; Canada/epidemiology; *Activities of Daily Living; Aging/*physiology; *Canadian longitudinal study on aging; *Life-space mobility; *Rehabilitation; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; Mobility Limitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, prevention or reduction of obesity could prevent high  OS and subsequently serve as a target for ""healthy aging."" METHODS: Diacron's  reactive oxygen metabolites test (D-ROM) and total thiol levels (TTL), a marker of  antioxidant defense capacity, were measured in 1,734 participants of a  population-based cohort study of older adults (age range: 57-83 years) at 2 time  points 3 years apart. The longitudinal associations of body mass index, waist-to-hip  ratio, and waist circumference with D-ROM and TTL were assessed with multivariable  adjusted generalized linear models. Dose-response analyses were conducted with  restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: D-ROM was not significantly associated with any  of the weight measures. On the contrary, TTL showed statistically significant,  inverse linear associations with all weight measures. CONCLUSION: A healthy body  weight seems to be highly relevant for the antioxidative defense capacity of human  beings. In contrast, D-ROM levels were independent of the study participant's  weight. Clinical trials are needed to corroborate if loss of weight by obese  individuals can effectively increase TTL and subsequently also life expectancy.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:39:43","","66-76","","1","13","","Obes Facts","","","","","","","","eng","© 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

The responses indicate the service performance in older adults' care,  clustered into three areas of analysis: health care for active and healthy aging (45  indicators, d1), chronic noncommunicable diseases care (89 indicators, d2), and  support network in aging care (21 indicators, d3). Performance was measured by the  sum of positive (value 1) or negative (value 0) responses for each indicator.  Services were clustered according to k-means of the performance scores of each  domain. After weighting the domains (Z tests), we estimated the associations between  the scores of each domain and independent management variables (typology, planning  and evaluation of services), with simple and multiple linear regression. RESULTS:  Chronic noncommunicable diseases care (d2) showed, for all clusters, better average  performance (55.7) than domains d1 (35.4) and d3 (39.2). Service performance in the  general area of planning and evaluation associates with the performance of older  adults' care. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated services had incipient implementation of  comprehensive care for older adults. The evaluation framework can contribute to  processes to improve the quality of primary health care.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:54:54","","06","","","54","","Rev Saude Publica","","","","","","","","por","","","","","","","PMID: 31967275  PMCID: PMC6961969","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Health Services for the Aged -- organization & administration; Brazil; Comprehensive Health Care/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data; Health Services Accessibility/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data; Health Services for the Aged/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data; National Health Programs; Primary Health Care/organization & administration/*statistics & numerical data; Primary Health Care -- organization & administration; Comprehensive Health Care -- organization & administration; Comprehensive Health Care -- statistics & numerical data; Health Services Accessibility -- organization & administration; Health Services Accessibility -- statistics & numerical data; Health Services for the Aged -- statistics & numerical data; Primary Health Care -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants from this cohort were included if they completed at least four  waves of measurements. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, demographics,  medical diagnoses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease), and  lifestyle-related information (e.g., smoking, drinking alcohol, and exercise) were  collected from participants (N = 2,584; mean age at baseline = 73.3) at least four  times across 12 years. MMSE scores were entered into a latent class mixed model  analysis. Subsequently, demographic, medical, and lifestyle predictors were entered  into multinomial logistic regression models to predict the trajectories. One of the  four emerged classes (no decline) was characterized by an absence of cognitive  decline; the other three exhibited various degrees of cognitive decline. The  inclusion of lifestyle factors significantly improved the prediction of the  different trajectories, above and beyond demographics and medical variables; the 'no  decline' class was significantly more likely to report exercising regularly. Changes  in cognitive functioning across the late-life period are characterized by multiple  trajectories. Cognitive decline is not inevitable across the late-life period; the  absence of such cognitive decline is partly explained by certain lifestyle factors.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:44:56","","1555-1563","","4","73","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31958087  PMCID: PMC8082094","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Cognition; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; China; Healthy Aging; *Cognition; *Life Style; Disease Progression; *exercise; Cognitive Dysfunction/psychology; *Cognitive aging; *cognitive function; *late-life; *latent class mixed model; *lifestyle; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; cognitive function; Cognitive aging; late-life; lifestyle; Cognitive Dysfunction -- psychology; exercise; latent class  mixed model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Life and Living in Advanced Age: a  Cohort Study in New Zealand (LiLACS NZ) is an ongoing longitudinal study  investigating the determinants of healthy ageing. Using data from LiLACS NZ, this  study aimed to determine whether a higher DBI was associated with poorer outcomes  (hospitalisation, falls, mortality and cognitive function and functional status)  over 36 months follow-up. METHODS: LiLACS NZ consists of two cohorts: Māori (the  indigenous population of New Zealand) aged ≥ 80 years and non-Māori aged 85 years at  the time of enrolment. Data relating to regularly prescribed medications at  baseline, 12 months and 24 months were used in this study. Medications with  anticholinergic and/or sedative properties (i.e. medications with a DBI > 0) were  identified using the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities (MIMS) medication  formulary, New Zealand. DBI was calculated for everyone enrolled at each time point.  The association between DBI at baseline and outcomes was evaluated throughout a  series of 12-month follow-ups using negative binomial (hospitalisations and falls),  Cox (mortality) and linear (cognitive function and functional status) regression  analyses (significance p < 0.05). Regression models were adjusted for age, gender,  general practitioner (GP) visits, socioeconomic deprivation, number of medicines  prescribed and one of the following: prior hospitalisation, history of falls,  baseline cognitive function [Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)] or  baseline functional status [Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL)].  RESULTS: Full demographic data were obtained for 671, 510 and 403 individuals at  baseline, 12 months and 24 months, respectively. Overall, 31%, 30% and 34% of  individuals were prescribed a medication with a DBI > 0 at baseline, 12 months and  24 months, respectively. At baseline and 12 months, non-Māori had a greater mean DBI  (0.28 ± 0.5 and 0.27 ± 0.5, respectively) compared to Māori (0.16 ± 0.3 and  0.18 ± 0.5, respectively). At baseline, the most commonly prescribed medicines with  a DBI > 0 were zopiclone, doxazosin, amitriptyline and codeine. In Māori, a higher  DBI was significantly associated with a greater risk of mortality: at 36 months  follow-up, adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.89 (1.11-3.20),  p = 0.02. In non-Māori, a higher DBI was significantly associated with a greater  risk of mortality [at 12 months follow-up, adjusted hazard ratio (95% CIs) 2.26  (1.09-4.70), p = 0.03] and impaired cognitive function [at 24 months follow-up,  adjusted mean difference in 3MS score (95% CIs) 0.89 (- 3.89 to - 0.41), p = 0.02).  CONCLUSIONS: Using data from LiLACS NZ, a higher DBI was significantly associated  with a greater risk of mortality (in Māori and non-Māori) and impaired cognitive  function (in non-Māori). This highlights the importance of employing strategies to  manage the prescribing of medications with a DBI > 0 in older adults.","2020-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:42:59","","205-213","","3","37","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 31919805","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Regression Analysis; Accidental Falls; *Evidence-Based Medicine; Cholinergic Antagonists/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Hospitalization; Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Inappropriate Prescribing/*adverse effects; Cholinergic Antagonists; Cholinergic Antagonists -- adverse effects; Cholinergic Antagonists -- therapeutic use; Evidence-Based Medicine; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- adverse effects; Hypnotics and Sedatives -- therapeutic use; Inappropriate Prescribing -- adverse effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Logistic regression modeling was used  to investigate the prevalence of dual sensory loss and the unmet needs for vision  and hearing devices in older women (compared to men) over time, as well as its  impacts on self-reported general health, depression, perceived social activities,  community service use and ageing in place. Results suggested that the prevalence of  dual sensory loss increased for women from the age of 75 years and over. Dual  sensory loss was higher for older women and men who were living alone, with  government benefits as their main income source or were divorced, separated or  widowed. Dual sensory loss had significant impacts on poor general health, perceived  inadequate social activities and community service use for women and men and on  depression for women only. Early identification of dual sensory loss is essential to  minimize its effects, ensuring continued well-being for this population.","2019-12-30","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","1","17","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31905935  PMCID: PMC6981467","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Australia; Logistic Models; *well-being; *quality of life; *Australia; *dual sensory loss; *Hearing Loss; *mental health; *older women; *physical health; *social health; *Vision Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given known sex differences in epigenetic aging, we explored sex-specific associations of 3 DNA methylation (DNAm)-based measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) with baseline and longitudinal change in cognitive performance among middle-aged urban adults.Methods: We used exploratory data from a subgroup of participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study with complete DNA samples and whose baseline ages were >50.0 years (2004-2009) to estimate 3 DNAm EAA measures: (1) universal EAA (AgeAccel); (2) intrinsic EAA (IEAA); and (3) extrinsic EAA (EEAA). Cognitive performance was measured at baseline visit (2004-2009) and first follow-up (2009-2013) with 11 test scores covering global mental status and specific domains such as learning/memory, attention, visuospatial, psychomotor speed, language/verbal, and executive function. A series of mixed-effects regression models were conducted adjusting for covariates and multiple testing (n = 147-156, ∼51% men, k = 1.7-1.9 observations/participant, mean follow-up time ∼4.7 years).Results: EEAA, a measure of both biological age and immunosenescence, was consistently associated with greater cognitive decline among men on tests of visual memory/visuoconstructive ability (Benton Visual Retention Test: γ11 = 0.0512 ± 0.0176, p = 0.004) and attention/processing speed (Trail-Making Test, part A: γ11 = 0.219 ± 0.080, p = 0.007). AgeAccel and IEAA were not associated with cognitive change in this sample.Conclusions: EEAA capturing immune system cell aging was associated with faster decline among men in domains of attention and visual memory. Larger longitudinal studies are needed to replicate our findings.","2020-02-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:19:21","","e613-e625","","6","94","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 American Academy of Neurology.","","","","","","PMID: 31879275  PMCID: PMC7136071","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Performance; Urban Population; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; DNA Methylation; Attention; Executive Function; *DNA Methylation; *Epigenesis, Genetic; Aging/*genetics/psychology; Cognitive Dysfunction/*genetics/psychology; Immunosenescence/genetics; Genes; Middle Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People age differently, and there is a need to disentangle whether healthy-ageing pathways can be shaped by cohort effects. This study aims to analyse trends in health status in two large nationally representative samples of older adults from England and the USA.Methods: The sample comprised 55 684 participants from the first seven waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the first 11 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). A common latent health score based on Bayesian multilevel item response theory was used. Two Bayesian mixed-effects multilevel models were used to assess cohort effects on health in ELSA and HRS separately, controlling for the effect of household wealth and educational attainment.Results: Similar ageing trends were found in ELSA (β = -0.311; p < 0.001) and HRS (β = -0.393; p < 0.001). The level of education moderated the life-course effect on health in both ELSA (β = -0.082; p < 0.05) and HRS (β = -0.084; p < 0.05). A birth-year effect was found for those belonging to the highest quintiles of household wealth in both ELSA (β = 0.125; p < 0.001) and HRS (β = 0.170; p < 0.001).Conclusions: Health inequalities have increased in recent cohorts, with the wealthiest participants presenting a better health status in both the USA and English populations. Actions to promote health in the ageing population should consider the increasing inequality scenario, not only by applying highly effective interventions, but also by making them accessible to all members of society.","2019-12-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:37:07","","1906-1913","","6","48","","Int J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

However, these relationships are not well described in older adults.  METHODS: Participants were 1242 older men (mean age 84 ± 4 years) in the  Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study. Jump peak power (Watts/kg body weight),  force (Newton/kg body weight) at peak power, and velocity (m/s) at peak power were  measured by jump tests on a force plate. Grip strength (kg/kg body weight) was  assessed by hand-held dynamometry. Physical performance included 400 m walk time  (s), 6 m usual gait speed (m/s), and 5-repeated chair stands speed (#/s). RESULTS:  In adjusted Pearson correlations, power/kg and velocity moderately correlated with  all performance measures (range r = 0.41-0.51; all p < 0.001), while correlations  for force/kg and grip strength/kg were weaker (range r = 0.20-0.33; all p < 0.001).  Grip strength/kg moderately correlated with power/kg (r = 0.44; p < 0.001) but not  velocity or force/kg.

Risk groups for this ""female disadvantage"" in physical performance  and it's development over successive birth cohorts are unknown. This is important  information for preventive strategies aimed to enhance healthy aging in all older  women. This study aims to longitudinal investigate whether there are risk groups for  a more apparent female disadvantage and study its trend over successive birth  cohorts. METHODS: Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) were used.  All participants were aged 55-65 years at baseline. Longitudinal data of two birth  cohorts with baseline measurements in 1992/1993 (n = 966, 24 year follow-up) and  2002/2003 (n = 1002, 12 year follow-up) were included. Follow-up measurements were  repeated every three/four years. Cross-sectional data of two additional cohorts were  included to compare ethnic groups: a Dutch cohort (2012/2013, n = 1023) and a  Migration cohort (2013/2014, n = 478) consisting of migrants with a Turkish/Moroccan  ethnicity. RESULTS: Mixed model analysis showed that women aged 55 years and older  had a lower age- and height-adjusted gait speed (-0.03 m/s; -0.063-0.001), chair  stand speed (-0.05 stand/s; -0.071--0.033), handgrip strength (-14,8 kg;  -15.69--13.84) and balance (OR = 0.71; 0.547-0.916) compared to men. The sex  difference in handgrip strength diminished with increasing age, but remained stable  for gait speed, chair stand speed and balance. In general, results were consistent  across different, educational levels and Turkish/Moroccan ethnic groups and birth  cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: There is a consistent ""female disadvantage"" in physical  performance among older adults, which remains stable with increasing age (except for  handgrip strength) and is consistent across different educational levels, ethnic  groups and successive birth cohorts. So, no specific risk groups for the female  disadvantage in physical performance were identified. Preventive strategies aimed to  enhance healthy aging in older women are needed and should target all older women.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:58:26","","e0226342","","12","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31851709  PMCID: PMC6919600","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Sex Characteristics; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Ethnic Groups; Netherlands; *Aging/ethnology; *Educational Status; Physical Functional Performance; *Physical Functional Performance; *Sex Characteristics; Body Height; Morocco/ethnology; Turkey/ethnology; Aging -- ethnology; Morocco -- ethnology; Turkey -- ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 1,042 adults in the Successful AGing  Evaluation (SAGE)-a multicohort study of adult community-dwelling residents of San  Diego County, California-were analyzed. Presence of meaning (""Presence"") and search  for meaning in life (""Search"") were assessed with the Meaning in Life Questionnaire.  Physical and mental well-being were measured using the Short Form 36 Health Survey  (SF-36). Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified was employed to screen  for overall cognitive function. Study data were collected from January 2013 to June  2014. RESULTS: Presence of meaning exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship  whereas Search showed a U-shaped relationship with age (with Presence peaking and  Search reaching the lowest point around age 60). Statistical modeling using  generalized estimating equations revealed that physical well-being (SF-36 physical  composite score) correlated negatively with age (P < .001) and positively with  Presence (P < .001), and there was an age group x Presence interaction (P = .018),  such that the relationship was stronger in subjects over age 60. Mental well-being  correlated positively with age (P < .001) and Presence (P < .001) and negatively  with Search (P = .002).

Significant covariates of Presence and Search had small  effect sizes, except for a medium effect size for satisfaction with life and  Presence in adults over age 60 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Presence and search for  meaning in life are important for health and well-being, though the relationships  differ in adults younger and older than 60 years. Better understanding of the  longitudinal relationships of meaning of life with well-being is warranted to design  interventions to increase meaning of life and improve health and functioning.","2019-12-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","1","81","","J Clin Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© Copyright 2019 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 31846240  PMCID: PMC7138140","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Personal Satisfaction; Young Adult; *Cognition; *Health Status; California; Healthy Aging/*psychology; *Emotional Adjustment; Independent Living/psychology/statistics & numerical data; Quality of Life/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there are few studies focusing on the effects of long-duration physical activity interventions in older adults. This study examined the effects of an 8-month multicomponent intervention on cardiorespiratory capacity (6-minute walking test), body composition (body-mass index), muscle strength (handgrip and knee extension), and bone mineral density (femoral neck) in a group of nonagenarians. A secondary aim was to determine the impact of the program according to the participant's way of life (institutionalized vs. community dwelling). A total of 14 institutionalized nonagenarians (years: 93.1 ± 1.6; female: 100%) and 16 community-dwelling nonagenarians (years: 93.1 ± 1.6; female: 75%) participated in this study. Our analysis suggested that the multicomponent program significantly improved the levels of strength in handgrip and leg extension in all participants. Intergroup analysis showed that the changes experienced were greater in community-dwelling people. Improvements in the cardiorespiratory capacity of older adults-more distance walked in 6 minutes-who were living in the nursing home (mean distance traveled: 238.5 ± 96.0 vs. 250.7 ± 99.0 m) were observed. Our findings found that an 8-month, multicomponent intervention program results in significant improvements in the levels of strength (handgrip and knee extension) in nonagenarians. This effect is greater in community-dwelling people.","2020-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:37:07","","217-223","","3","23","","Rejuvenation Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31822212","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Exercise -- physiology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Body Composition -- physiology; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Muscle Strength/*physiology; Independent Living; Exercise/physiology; Treatment Outcome; Portugal; Hand Strength; Aging/physiology; Body Composition/*physiology; Bone Density/*physiology; Cardiorespiratory Fitness/*physiology; Exercise Therapy/*methods; fitness; health; longevity; physical activity; Bone Density -- physiology; Cardiorespiratory Fitness -- physiology; Exercise Therapy -- methods; Muscle Strength -- physiology; Community Living; Impact of Events Scale; Randomized Controlled Trials; Grip Strength; Treatment Outcomes; Therapeutic Exercise -- Methods; Body Composition -- Physiology; Bone Density -- Physiology; Muscle Strength -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Living longer does not entail living healthier; however, there is not a  widely accepted measure of healthy ageing hampering policy and research. The World  Health Organization defines healthy ageing as the process of developing and  maintaining functional ability that will enable well-being in older age. We aimed to  create a healthy ageing index (HAI) in a subset of six low-and-middle income  countries, part of the 10/66 study, by using items of functional ability and  intrinsic capacity. METHODS: The study sample included residents 65-years old and  over (n = 12,865) from catchment area sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru,  Venezuela, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Items were collected by interviewing participants  or key informants between 2003 and 2010. Two-stage factor analysis was employed and  we compared one-factor, second-order and bifactor models. The psychometric  properties of the index, including reliability, replicability, unidimensionality and  concurrent convergent validity as well as measurement invariance per ethnic group  and gender were further examined in the best fit model. RESULTS: The bifactor model  displayed superior model fit statistics supporting that a general factor underlies  the various items but other subdomain factors are also needed. The HAI indicated  excellent reliability (ω = 0.96, ω(Η) = 0.84), replicability (H = 0.96), some  support for unidimensionality (Explained Common Variance = 0.65) and some concurrent  convergent validity with self-rated health. Scalar measurement invariance per ethnic  group and gender was supported. CONCLUSIONS: A HAI with excellent psychometric  properties was created by using items of functional ability and intrinsic capacity  in a subset of six low-and-middle income countries.

The aim of this study was to  investigate how differences in study recruitment may affect final pathological  composition of cohort studies. The UoM cohort was established as a longitudinal  study of aging and cognition whereas the BDR program was established, prima facie,  to collect brains from both demented and non-demented individuals for the purpose of  building a tissue research resource. Consequently, the differences in recruitment  patterns generated differences in demographic, clinical, and neuropathological  characteristics. There was a higher proportion of recruits with dementia [mostly  Alzheimer's disease (AD)] within the BDR cohort than in the UoM cohort. In  pathological terms, the BDR cohort was more 'polarized', being more composed of  demented cases with high Braak pathology scores and non-demented cases with low  Braak scores, and fewer non-AD pathology cases, than the UoM cohort. In both  cohorts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy tended to be greater in demented than  non-demented individuals. Such observations partly reflect the recruitment of  demented and non-demented individuals into the BDR cohort, and also that  insufficient study time may have elapsed for disease onset and development in  non-demented individuals to take place. Conversely, in the UoM cohort, where there  had been nearly 30 years of study time, a broader spread of AD-type pathological  changes had 'naturally' evolved in the brains of both demented and non-demented  participants.","2020","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:13:19","","619-632","","2","73","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31796669  PMCID: PMC7029329","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Cognition; Aging -- pathology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Apolipoproteins E; Apolipoproteins E -- genetics; Brain -- pathology; Dementia -- pathology; Dementia -- psychology; Neuropsychological Tests; Aging -- genetics; Alzheimer Disease -- pathology; Dementia -- epidemiology; Alzheimer Disease -- psychology; *Cognition; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; longitudinal studies; *dementia; Alzheimer’s disease; *Alzheimer’s disease; *cognitive dysfunction; *cohort studies; *longitudinal studies; *neuropathology; Age of Onset; Aging/genetics/*pathology; Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology/pathology/psychology; Brain/growth & development/*pathology; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology/genetics; Dementia/epidemiology/*pathology/psychology; DNA/genetics; Healthy Aging/genetics/*psychology; Patient Selection; United Kingdom/epidemiology; dementia; cohort studies; Cognitive Dysfunction -- epidemiology; Healthy Aging -- psychology; Healthy Aging -- genetics; 9007-49-2; Alzheimer Disease -- epidemiology; Brain -- growth & development; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy -- pathology; cognitive dysfunction; Cognitive Dysfunction -- genetics; DNA; DNA -- genetics; neuropathology; United Kingdom -- epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants with long-lived parents and who exercised had a lower risk of being non-healthy agers. Being overweight, obese or a smoker increased the risk of being a non-healthy ager. Physically active participants had increased odds of healthy aging at age 77 (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.46) and at age 90 (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.01-2.24).

Maternal longevity was associated with healthy aging only at age 77 (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04-1.72).Conclusions: Our findings support the view that a combination of genetic and behavioral factors is associated with healthy aging.

This study seeks to identify the biological indicators that relate  to HRQoL among a group of older Korean adults using a machine-learning approach.  METHODS: We used physical and mental scores from the 36-item Short Form Health  Survey (SF-36) to measure HRQoL among older Korean adults who participated in the  Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) biomarker pilot study (N = 385). The  variables for the multivariate penalized regression analysis included demographic  factors, medical measurements, physical performance, and health-related behaviors.  RESULTS: The multivariate profiles identified several significant biomarkers that  relate to quality of life. Among the 20 variables, handgrip strength was the most  powerful indicator in both men and women for the SF-36 physical scores, followed by  walking speed. Age and total sleep duration exclusively were significantly  associated with the SF-36 physical scores only in women, whereas body mass index,  blood pressure, and sit-to-stand times were unique elements in men. CONCLUSIONS: The  present study suggests significant physical indicators that explain quality of life  in elderly populations, using a data-driven approach. Based on these findings,  maintaining a good level of physical performance is considered a key element of  successful aging.","2020-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:54:26","","103966","","","87","","Arch Gerontol Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

International reference bodies (the ILO, the European Commission, the European  Agency -EU_OSHA- ...) and national organizations have begun to address this problem.  Preventing and adapting working conditions to health problems linked to age is a  fundamental task of the Occupational Risk Prevention Services (ORPS) although it is  unknown to what extent it is being carried out. The objective of this study was to  estimate how this emerging risk is being addressed. METHODS: A descriptive,  multicenter and crosssectional study was conducted based on the data provided by the  ORPS of Public Administrations of three Autonomous Communities, Madrid, the Basque  Country and Navarre, Period 2012-2016. The actions performed according to age,  economic activity, occupation and size of the work center were analyzed by  calculating distribution percentages and association analysis by Prevalence Ratios  with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Information was collected from 14  ORPS, all with their own resources. In the majority (11 out of 14) age was not  considered in either risk assessments or health surveillance. Small centers  performed more frequently the adaptation of job, Risk of Prevalence 1.25 (95% CI  1.12-1.40). In those with more than 5,000 workers, the proportion of relocations was  greater (9/1,000 vs 6/1,000). The age of 55 was the risk threshold. In addition to  the risks inherent in the tasks, psychosocials were identified in all activities.  CONCLUSIONS: Age is especially sensitive to occupational risks, it must be  considered in the evaluation, as well as in the design and adaptation of jobs, a  fundamental task of the ORPS.","2019-11-27","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","","93","","Rev Esp Salud Publica","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","","","Place: Spain PMID: 31772148","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence; Health Promotion; Job Satisfaction; *Healthy Aging; *Aging; Retrospective Studies; Spain; Health promotion; Occupational Health/*standards; Occupational medicine; Occupational Medicine/*methods; Occupations; Preventive Medicine/*methods; Risk Assessment/*methods; Work satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional  study of baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Data  from 1,404 participants with hand, hip, and/or knee OA were included. A series of  regression analyses were conducted with independent variables of food intake (fiber  and high calorie snack intake) and nutrition risk; and dependent variables of  physical capacity and general health. Physical capacity was characterized through  grip strength and a pooled index of four mobility tests. General health was  characterized through an index of self-reported general health, mental health, and  healthy aging. RESULTS: Higher fiber intake was related to greater mobility (p =  .01). Food intake was not related to any other outcome. Nutrition risk was  significantly associated with mobility (p < .001) and general health (p < .001);  those with a high nutrition risk classification had poorer general health (p < .001,  d = 0.65) than those at low nutrition risk. As well, those with moderate nutrition  risk had poorer general health than those with low nutrition risk (p = .001, d =  0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition risk screening for older adults with OA provides  insight into behavioral characteristics associated with reduced mobility and poorer  general health. Also, those consuming greater amounts of fiber demonstrated better  mobility. Thus, this research suggests that quality of diet and nutritional  behaviors can impact both physical and mental aspects of health in those with OA.","2020-10-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2147-2155","","11","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

However, we suggest that one reason why  financial security is important for retirees is that it enables social  connectedness, which is critical for healthy ageing. METHODS: This paper tests this  hypothesis cross-sectionally (N = 3109) and longitudinally (N = 404) using a  population-weighted mixed effects mediation model in two nationally representative  samples of Australian retirees. RESULTS: Analyses provide robust support for our  model. Subjective financial security predicted retiree health cross-sectionally and  longitudinally. Social connectedness also consistently predicted mental health and  physical health, on average four times more strongly than financial security.  Furthermore, social connectedness partially accounted for the protective effect of  subjective financial security. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the implications of these  findings for public health, with a particular emphasis on how social connectedness  can be better supported for people transitioning to retirement.","2019-11-21","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","319","","1","19","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31752692  PMCID: PMC6868702","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Australia; *Retirement; *Healthy ageing; *Mental health; *Belonging; *Income; *Loneliness; *Psychological Distance; *Social capital; *Social determinants; Friends; Retirement/*economics/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using up to 12 years of  repeated measures data, we identified trajectories in cognitive function among  community-dwelling older Japanese adults. We then examined whether these  trajectories were associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and  differences in healthcare costs. METHODS: A total of 1736 adults aged ≥65 years who  were free of disabling dementia completed annual assessments during 2002-2014.  Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. The average  number of follow-up assessments was 3.9, and the total number of observations was  6824 during the follow-up period. RESULTS: We identified five trajectory patterns in  cognitive function (high, second, third, fourth, and low) during the 12-year  follow-up period. The low (2.0%) and fourth (2.2%) trajectory groups had higher  hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease mortality, and hazard ratios for other  cause mortality were significantly higher for the third (16.8%) and second (38.8%)  trajectory groups than for the high trajectory group (40.3%). Until 5 years of  follow up, participants in the two lower-trajectory groups had higher mean combined  monthly medical and long-term care costs. After 8 years of follow up, mean costs  were highest for the third trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death from  cardiovascular disease was higher in the two lower-trajectory groups in cognitive  function, and they showed higher healthcare costs during the first 5 years of follow  up. After 8 years of follow up, the third trajectory had the highest healthcare  costs, perhaps because of hospitalizations attributable to gradual cognitive  decline.

These  changes in movement-related behaviors (MRBs) might be associated with unhealthy  weight gain and several health comorbidities. However, information is lacking on how  obesity influences longitudinal changes in the composition of MRBs in older adults.  Furthermore, the moderating effect of the built environment on prospective  associations between obesity and MRBs in older adults is not fully understood.  Therefore, using an integrated time-use approach, this study aims to identify  prospective associations between obesity and MRBs together with an assessment of the  moderating effect of the built environment in elderly women. METHODS: The study was  designed as a prospective 7-year follow-up study. It is based on two previous  cross-sectional studies that enable the use of participant data (women aged 60+  years, n = 409) as a baseline dataset in the current study. All methods designed for  7-year follow-up are based on previous studies. The data collection comprises  device-based measurement of MRBs (ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer), objective  assessment of body adiposity (multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis),  subjective assessment of the built environment (NEWS-A questionnaire), and other  possible confounding factors. Time spent in sedentary behavior, light physical  activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be used as three  components in a composition reflecting individual MRBs. In linear multiple  compositional regression analysis assessing the prospective association between  obesity and MRBs, the 7-year follow-up composition of the three mentioned components  represents the dependent variable. The 7-year changes in the percentage of body fat  (body adiposity), baseline composition of MRBs, and parameters of the built  environment represent regressors. DISCUSSION: This study will use an integrated  time-use approach to explore causality from obesity to device-measured behaviors in  older women. The design and respective analysis consider the compositional nature of  MRBs data and the potential moderating effects of various factors. A comprehensive  assessment of causality may help to develop multilevel interventional models that  enhance physical activity in older adults.","2019-11-14","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1522","","1","19","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31727040  PMCID: PMC6857272","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Body Mass Index; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Linear Models; *Exercise; Research Design; Healthy aging; *Health Behavior; *Sedentary Behavior; *Adiposity; *Environment Design; Adipose Tissue/*metabolism; Causality; Health risk behaviors; Obesity/*complications; Regression analysis; Risk factors; Weight Gain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the  present study, a computed estimate of BA was investigated longitudinally in 3,558  individuals using deep phenotyping, which encompassed a broad range of biological  processes. The Klemera-Doubal algorithm was applied to longitudinal data consisting  of genetic, clinical laboratory, metabolomic, and proteomic assays from individuals  undergoing a wellness program. BA was elevated relative to CA in the presence of  chronic diseases. We observed a significantly lower rate of change than the expected  ~1 year/year (to which the estimation algorithm was constrained) in BA for  individuals participating in a wellness program. This observation suggests that BA  is modifiable and suggests that a lower BA relative to CA may be a sign of healthy  aging. Measures of metabolic health, inflammation, and toxin bioaccumulation were  strong predictors of BA. BA estimation from deep phenotyping was seen to change in  the direction expected for both positive and negative health conditions. We believe  BA represents a general and interpretable ""metric for wellness"" that may aid in  monitoring aging over time.","2019-11-13","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:28:13","","S52-S60","","Suppl_1","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

We estimate inequalities in diabetes incidence, prevalence and mortality  and assess the economic burden on the healthcare system in Costa Rica. The main  source of data is the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study, a longitudinal  nationally representative survey of the elderly population (n = 2827). Data analyses  include descriptive statistics, multiple regression models and survival analysis  models. More than a fifth of Costa Rican elderly experience diabetes. Incidence is  estimated at 5 per 1000 person-years in the population 30+. Gender and geographical  inequalities were found. Men have a significantly lower prevalence (16.51% vs  24.02%, P < 0.05) and incidence (4.3 vs 6.0 per 1000 person-years, P < 0.05), but  higher mortality (hazard ratio = 1.31, P < 0.01). Longer time to the closest  facility translates into a lower probability of having the condition diagnosed [odds  ratio (OR) = 0.77, P < 0.05]. The diabetic as compared to the non-diabetic  population imposes a larger economic burden on the healthcare system with a higher  probability of using outpatient care (OR = 3.08, P < 0.01), medications (OR = 3.44,  P < 0.01) and hospitalizations (OR = 1.24, P > 0.05). Individuals living in the  Metro Area have a significantly lower probability of being hospitalized (OR = 0.72,  P < 0.05), which may be evidence of better access to primary care that prevents  hospitalization. Along the same line, women have higher utilization rates of  outpatient care (OR = 2.02, P < 0.01) and medications (OR = 1.73, P < 0.01), which  may contribute to lower odds of hospitalization (OR = 0.61, P < 0.01). Aligned with  the aim of attaining Sustainable Development Goals, this study highlights the  importance of generating health policies focused on prevention of diabetes that take  into consideration gender and geographical inequalities. Strategies should booster  preventive healthcare utilization by men and aim to make healthcare services  accessible to all, regardless of geographical location.","2019-11-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:41:00","","ii45-ii55","","Supplement_2","34","","Health Policy Plan","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

RESULTS: Three main findings from  multilevel analyses emerged. First, older adults showed significant within-person  variation in attachment security, satisfaction of the needs for autonomy and  competence, and psychological adjustment over time. Second, attachment security was  positively associated with psychological adjustment within individuals. Third, both  satisfaction of the needs for autonomy and competence mediated the within-person  association between attachment security and psychological adjustment.

The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in dietary patterns and nutrient intake in an older population, in order to increase the understanding of whether dietary recommendations are followed and if nutrient needs are met.Methods: Cross-sectional data was derived from five samples of 70-year-olds examined 1971-72, 1981-83, 1992-93, 2000-02 and 2014-16 from the Gothenburg H70 birth cohort studies in Sweden. A total of 2246 individuals (56% women) participated. Dietary intake was determined by the diet history method, which is an interview including questions on usual frequencies and portion sizes of food intake during the preceding three months. Recommended values of nutrient intake and determinants of healthful dietary patterns were based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2012. Statistical analyses were performed using general linear models, student's t-test and chi-square test, stratified by sex.Results: The intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and seafood, whole grain products and nuts and seeds increased during the study period (p < 0.0001), among both sexes. However, there was also an increase in alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), especially from wine and beer, and in 2014-16 more than 30% had an alcohol intake above recommendations. Protein intake increased (p < 0.0001 for women and p = 0.0004 for men), and 48% of the women and 37% of the men had a protein intake above recommended 1.2 g/kg body weight and day in 2014-16. The proportion of participants at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins C, D and folate decreased during the study period, among both sexes (p < 0.0001). However, vitamin D intake from diet was still below average requirement level of 7.5 μg/day for 49% of the women and 32% of the men in 2014-16.Conclusions: Dietary patterns have changed among 70-year-olds during the past five decades, with an increase in healthful foods and a higher nutrient density in later born birth cohorts. However, the intake of alcohol increased, especially among women. Results from this study can be useful as a basis for dietary guidelines and used for prevention strategies involving older adults in population-based and health care settings.","2019-11-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:27:01","","66","","1","18","","Nutr J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31694635  PMCID: PMC6836447","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutritional Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Aging; *Older adults; Older adults; Sweden; *Health Behavior; *Nutritional Status; *Diet history; *Dietary patterns; *Energy intake; *Macronutrients; *Micronutrients; *Nutrient intake; *Time trends; Diet/*methods/*statistics & numerical data/trends; Time; Energy intake; Diet -- methods; Diet -- statistics & numerical data; Diet -- trends; Diet history; Dietary patterns; Macronutrients; Micronutrients; Nutrient intake; Time trends; Questionnaires; Diet -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Diet -- Methods; Diet -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adequate vitamin D status may be important in preserving  muscle function. We aimed to determine the association between impaired muscle  function and serum vitamin D status in community-dwelling older adults. Falls were  explored as a secondary aim. METHODS: Data were analyzed from adults aged ≥60 years,  from Wave 6 of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA). Handgrip strength  (HGS) and the short physical performance battery (SPPB) were employed as measures of  muscle strength and physical function, respectively. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D  [25(OH)D] was assessed with concentration <30 nmol/L classed as vitamin D deficient.  RESULTS: The study comprised 4157 community-dwelling adults with a mean age of 69.8  (SD 6.9). Overall, 30.6% had low HGS and 12.7% had low SPPB (≤6). Participants with  the lowest serum 25(OH)D (<30 nmol/L) had the highest prevalence of impaired muscle  strength and performance (40.4% and 25.2%) compared with participants with levels  ≥50 nmol/L (21.6% and 7.9%). Consistent with this, vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L)  was a significant determinant of low HGS (OR 1.44 [1.22, 1.71], p<0.001) and poor  physical performance (OR 1.65 [1.31, 2.09], p<0.001) in the logistic regression  models. Older adults partaking in regular moderate physical activity had  significantly lower odds of impaired muscle strength (OR 0.65 [0.58, 0.79]) and  physical function (OR 0.30 [0.24, 0.38]), p <0.001, respectively. Single or multiple  falls (15.8% and 10.5% in past year) were not associated with vitamin D status.  CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with impaired muscle strength and  performance in a large study of community-dwelling older people. It is generally  accepted that vitamin D deficiency at the <30 nmol/L cut-off should be reversed to  prevent bone disease, a strategy that may also protect skeletal muscle function in  ageing.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1751-1761","","","14","","Clin Interv Aging","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 Aspell et al.","","","","","","PMID: 31686797  PMCID: PMC6800555","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; muscle function; Muscle Strength/*physiology; Exercise/physiology; ageing; Physical Functional Performance; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; Accidental Falls/prevention & control; Calcifediol; short physical performance battery; vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency/*diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology; Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implementation of such multi-component  programming is influenced by known program characteristics including novelty,  complexity and observability as well as related organizational factors. As such, we  explored ComSA CD's implementation from the organizational perspective, seeking to  inform program improvements. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups with program  staff, partners and trainers (total N = 21 participants). Findings were analysed  using an interpretative approach and synthesized into a line of argument informing  lessons learnt. RESULTS: An implementation framework was identified. It is guided by  considering the influence of known program characteristics across major themes,  representing three core implementation stages. These and supporting sub-themes are  elaborated in turn: 1) Creating commitment toward the program was challenged by  novelty and at times a lack of shared understanding of ComSA CD, particularly  relating to the S component. Overall, cohesion within organizational contexts and  having a strong rapport with the community (ability to engage) were needed to  persuade volunteers and participants to commit to the program. 2) Coordination and  resource allocation were influenced by the complexity of interconnecting BPS  components - requiring aligning communication between partners and adapting the BPS  sequence, given the separated management structure of program trainers. Efficiency  of resource utilization was constrained by the ability to pool and match resources  given the limited manpower and community partners who worked-in-silo due to a  KPI-centric culture. 3) Collaborative program monitoring and appraisal increased  observability of the program's benefits, but depended on partners' prior commitment.  Despite appreciating its holistic BPS programming, dropout rate was used as a way to  gauge program success, which has limited interpretability. Occasional uncertainty  about the program value contributed to concerns about duplicating existing ageing  programs, particularly those related to the B component. CONCLUSION: Lessons learnt  for improving BPS programming include (1) eliciting better participants' buy-in and  shared program vision, (2) increasing adaptability of BPS sequence and building a  culture of shared values for working together (3) and developing comprehensive  monitoring systems for program appraisal.","2019-10-30","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:56:47","","263","","1","19","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31664899  PMCID: PMC6820954","","","","Aged; Humans; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Social Behavior; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Singapore; Learning; Singapore/epidemiology; Aging/*psychology; *BioPsychoSocial health; *Delivery system evaluation; *Implementation science; *Social Behavior; *Successful ageing; Delivery of Health Care/*methods/trends; Focus Groups/methods; Independent Living/*psychology/trends; Community Living -- Psychosocial Factors; Community Living -- Trends; Focus Groups -- Methods; Health Care Delivery -- Methods; Health Care Delivery -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it remains unclear  whether beneficial effects of community engagement are independent of the well-known  protective effects of broader structural, functional and subjective social factors.  METHODS: We analysed data from 9550 adults aged 50+ from the English Longitudinal  Study of Ageing, with baseline from 2004 to 2005. We assessed associations between  different types of community engagement and dementia incidence over a 12-year  period. Specifically, we used Cox proportional hazards models, competing risk  regressions models, and modified Fine and Gray subdistribution hazards models while  controlling for all identified demographic, health-related, and social covariates.  RESULTS: Community cultural engagement (eg, visiting museums, galleries, the  theatre) was associated with a lower hazard of developing dementia in older age  independent of demographic, health-related and a broad range of social factors,  using all three statistical approaches (fully adjusted Cox models: HR 0.58, 95% CI  0.41 to 0.80). Community group engagement (eg, attending clubs or societies) was  only associated with dementia prior to adjustment for social factors. Results were  robust to sensitivity analyses considering reverse causality, over-adjustment and  baseline cognitive function. CONCLUSION: It is not just social factors that are  associated with reduced risk of dementia onset, but community engagement may also be  protective, particularly when relating to cultural activities. These findings are of  relevance when considering the current interest in social prescribing to support  healthy ageing.","2020-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:11:29","","71-77","","1","74","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

We sought to determine the extent to which self-reported sleep  disturbances, metabolic syndrome (MetS) factors, cellular inflammation, depressive  symptomatology, and diminished physical mobility were associated with cognitive  impairment and poorer cognitive performance. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional  study. SETTING: Participants with elevated, well-controlled blood pressure were  recruited from the local community for a Tai Chi and healthy-aging intervention  study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-five older adults (72.7 ± 7.9 years old; 66%  female), 54 (37%) with evidence of cognitive impairment (CI) based on Montreal  Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score ≤24, underwent medical, psychological, and mood  assessments. MEASUREMENTS: CI and cognitive domain performance were assessed using  the MoCA. Univariate correlations were computed to determine relationships between  risk factors and cognitive outcomes. Bootstrapped logistic regression was used to  determine significant predictors of CI risk and linear regression to explore  cognitive domains affected by risk factors. RESULTS: The CI group were slower on the  mobility task, satisfied more MetS criteria, and reported poorer sleep than  normocognitive individuals (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression  indicated that sleep disturbances, but no other risk factors, predicted increased  risk of evidence of CI (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.26-4.87, 99% CI: 1.08-7.48). Further  examination of MoCA cognitive subdomains revealed that sleep disturbances predicted  poorer executive function (β = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to -0.06, 99% CI: -0.61 to  -0.02), with lesser effects on visuospatial performance (β = -0.20, 95% CI: -0.35 to  -0.02, 99% CI: -0.39 to 0.03), and memory (β = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.01, 99%  CI: -0.76 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the deleterious impact of  self-reported sleep disturbances on cognitive performance was prominent over other  risk factors and illustrate the importance of clinician evaluation of sleep in  patients with or at risk of diminished cognitive performance. Future, longitudinal  studies implementing a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and objective sleep  measurement are warranted to further explore these associations.","2020-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","815-825","","7","32","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31647051  PMCID: PMC8011648","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Memory; *Aging; Self Report; *cognitive impairment; Sleep/physiology; *dementia; *blood pressure; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; *depressed mood; *inflammation; *metabolic syndrome; *physical mobility; *sleep; Cognitive Dysfunction/*complications; Hypertension/*complications; Sleep Wake Disorders/*physiopathology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Longitudinal cohort study with up to 15 study visits. Setting: Two sites of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Participants: Black (n=411) and white (N=419) women followed from median age 47.0 (44.6–49.6) to 62.0 (55.8–65.3) years. Interventions: N/A. Measurements: Performance on a stair climb test (ascend/descend 4 steps, 3 cycles) was timed. Physical activity (PA) was assessed using the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey (KPAS; possible range 0–15 points). Sociodemographic and health factors were assessed via self-report. BMI was calculated with measured height and weight. Mixed-effects regression modeled longitudinal change in stair climb performance.

Many do not have the resources or formal structures available to support the health and wellbeing of people as they age. In other contexts, the use of peer support programmes have shown favourable outcomes in terms of reducing loneliness, increasing physical activity and managing chronic disease. Such programmes have not been previously developed or tested in African countries. We piloted a peer-to-peer support model among vulnerable community-dwelling adults in a developing country (South Africa) to examine the program's effect on wellbeing and social engagement.Methods: A pre-post, pilot design was used to evaluate targeted outcomes, including wellbeing, social support, social interaction, mood, loneliness and physical activity. A total of 212 persons, aged 60+ years and living independently in a low-income area in Cape Town were recruited and screened for eligibility by trained assessors. Participants were assessed using the interRAI CheckUp, WHO-5 Wellbeing index, and the MOS-SS 8 instruments before and after the 5-month intervention, during which they received regular visits and phone calls from trained peer volunteers. During visits volunteers administered a wellness screening, made referrals to health and social services; built friendships with clients; encouraged social engagement; promoted healthy living; and provided emotional and informational support.Results: Volunteer visits with clients significantly increased levels of self-reported wellbeing by 58%; improved emotional and informational support by 50%; decreased reports of reduced social interaction by 91%; reduced loneliness by 70%; improved mood scores represented as anxiety, depression, lack of interest or pleasure in activities, and withdrawal from activities of interest; and increased levels of physical activity from 49 to 66%.Discussion: The intervention led to demonstrable improvement in client wellbeing. Policymakers should consider integrating peer-support models into existing health programs to better address the needs of the elderly population and promote healthy ageing in resource-poor community settings. Longer-term and more rigorous studies with a control group are needed to support these findings and to investigate the potential impact of such interventions on health outcomes longitudinally.","2019-10-22","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:22:49","","279","","1","19","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31640576  PMCID: PMC6805367","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Social Support; Self Report; Quality of Life/*psychology; *Home visitors; *interRAI check-up; *Peer Group; *Peer-to-peer support model; Counseling/economics/methods; Exercise/psychology; Healthy Aging/psychology; Loneliness/psychology; Poverty/*economics/*psychology; South Africa/epidemiology; Peer Group; Support, Psychosocial; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Loneliness -- Psychosocial Factors; Exercise -- Psychosocial Factors; Counseling -- Economics; Counseling -- Methods; Poverty -- Economics; Poverty -- Psychosocial Factors; South Africa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Risk reduction messages should include key recommendations for women in response to  the high prevalence of dementia observed in this population. Midlife is a critical  period for dementia-related brain changes and psychosocial crises. Psychological  well-being can improve resilience to crises, yet it is not well understood with  respect to dementia risk reduction. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the  association between midlife psychological well-being and cognitive function in later  life in women. METHODS: The study included 703 women from the British 1946 birth  cohort in the Medical Research Council's National Survey of Health and Development.  Psychological well-being at 52 years was assessed using the Ryff Scales of  Psychological Well-being over six dimensions: autonomy, environmental mastery,  personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and  self-acceptance. Cognitive function at 69 years was measured using the Addenbrooke's  Cognitive Examination, Third Edition. RESULTS: After controlling for cognitive  ability at eight years, educational attainment by 26 years, occupational attainment  and marital status by 53 years, depression, smoking, and physical exercise at 60-64  years, there was a significant association between greater personal growth and lower  self-acceptance at 52 years, and better cognition at 69 years. However, there was no  association between cognition and the other four Ryff scales. CONCLUSION: Most  aspects of midlife psychological well-being, except for personal growth and  self-acceptance, were not prospectively associated with cognition.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:31:54","","835-843","","3","72","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31640097  PMCID: PMC6894933","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Cognition/*physiology; Cohort studies; *dementia; *psychological well-being; England/epidemiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology/*psychology; *risk factors; *Cohort studies; *Surveys and Questionnaires; *women; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology; dementia; women; risk factors; psychological well-being; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- epidemiology; Healthy Aging -- psychology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- psychology; England -- epidemiology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DASH((mean)) (Dietary Approaches to  Stop Hypertension) score was computed using four 24 h recalls (v1/v2: 2004-2013)  linked with a national food price database to estimate monetary value of the diet  [MVD((mean))]. Allostatic load (AL) was measured at visits 2 (v2) and 3 (v3) in  2009-2018. Mixed-effects regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were  conducted, linking MVD((mean))/DASH((mean)) to AL [v2 and annual change(v3-v2)] and  exploring mediating pathways between MVD((mean)) and AL((v3)) through DASH((mean)),  stratifying by sex, race and poverty status. MVD((mean)) tertiles were linearly  associated with contemporaneous DASH((mean)), after energy adjustment. In  mixed-effects regression models, DASH((mean)) was consistently linked to lower  AL((v2)). DASH((mean)) and MVD((mean)) were positively associated with higher serum  albumin((v2)). In SEM, MVD((mean)) was linked to AL((v3)) through DASH((mean)),  mainly among Whites and specifically for the cholesterol and Waist-Hip-Ratio AL  components. In summary, energy and other covariate-adjusted increase in MVD may have  a sizeable impact on DASH which can reduce follow-up AL among urban White  middle-aged adults.

Physical activity, diet quality and sleep are all associated with health outcomes, but few studies have explored their independent associations with all-cause mortality in an older population in the same model. The study aim was to examine associations between step-count, self-reported diet quality, restless sleep, and all-cause mortality in adults aged 55-85 years.Design: A prospective cohort study of adults in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.Method: Data were from 1697 participants (49.3% women; baseline mean age 65.4 ± 7.1 years). Daily steps (measured by pedometer), diet quality (from a modified Australian Recommended Food Score), and frequency of restless sleep (by self-report) were assessed in relation to all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for sex, age, household income and smoking. Baseline data were collected between January 2005 and April 2008, and last follow-up was in March 2017 (median follow-up 9.6 years).Results: Higher step count (HR: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.88-0.98 per 1000-step increment) and higher diet quality (HR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.74-0.99 per 8-point increment in diet quality score) were associated with reduced mortality risk. Restless sleep for ≥3 nights/week was not associated with mortality risk (HR: 1.03, 95%CI: 0.78-1.39). Sensitivity analyses, adjusting for chronic disease and excluding deaths <1 year after baseline, did not change these estimates.Conclusions: Increased daily steps and consumption of a greater variety of nutrient-dense foods every week would result in substantial health benefits for older people.

Alterations in physiological functions,  such as inflammatory and metabolic, have been described in patients with depression.  However, little is known on the association between depression symptom course and  metabolic and inflammation dysregulation. This study aimed to depict the course of  depression symptoms while ageing, taking into consideration inter-individual  heterogeneity. Moreover, it intended to study the associations between inflammatory  and metabolic risk profiles and symptom trajectories. To do so, data from 13,203  adults aged 50-90 years (52.75% women; mean age at baseline = 65.07, SD = 10.00)  were used. Blood sample and blood pressure measures were taken from 1536  participants (56.58% women; mean age at baseline = 61.73 years, sd = 7.64).  Depression symptoms were assessed every two years across a 10-year follow-up.  Trajectories were identified by means of latent class mixed modelling. Inflammation  and metabolic risk profile scores were obtained from plasma and diagnostic-based  indicators in the follow-up, using a robust latent-factor approach. Multigroup  modelling was used to study the associations between the profiles and symptom  trajectories. As a result, three heterogeneous trajectories of symptoms were  identified (low-symptom, moderate-symptom and high-symptom trajectory). Participants  depicting a high-symptom trajectory showed the greatest inflammation profile score  and high metabolic risk. Moderate-symptom trajectory was also related to high  inflammation and metabolic risk. To sum up, at-risk trajectories of symptoms were  associated with high inflammation and risk of metabolic diseases. This study  provides valuable evidence to advance personalised medicine and mental health  precision, considering person-specific profiles and physiological concomitants.","2019-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","104443","","","110","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019.

The analysis is based on longitudinal information from a  subsample of 1,261 individuals aged 60+ years at baseline from the Costa Rican Study  of Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES): a nationally representative sample of  elderly population. Random effects regression models for panel data were used to  estimate the associations with LTL and its longitudinal changes. Sample collection  procedures and DNA refrigerator storage time were strongly associated with LTL:  telomeres are longer in blood collected in October-December, in DNA extracted from  <1-year-old blood cells, and in DNA stored at 4°C for longer periods of time up to  five years. The data confirmed that telomeres are shorter at older ages, as well as  among males, and diabetic individuals, whereas telomeres are longer in the  high-longevity Nicoya region. Most health, biomarkers, and early childhood  indicators did not show significant associations with LTL. Longitudinal LTL  variation over approximately two years was mainly associated with baseline LTL  levels, as found in other studies. Our findings suggest that if there is unavoidable  variability in season of sample collection and DNA storage time, these factors  should be controlled for in all demographic and epidemiologic studies of LTL.  However, due to unobserved components of measurement variation, statistical control  may be inadequate as compared to standardization of data collection procedures.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0223766","","10","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31603943  PMCID: PMC6788698","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Time Factors; Regression Analysis; Healthy Aging; *Longevity; Telomere/*genetics; Blood Specimen Collection/*methods; Costa Rica; DNA/*standards; Leukocytes/*chemistry; Telomere Homeostasis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PARTICIPANTS: HABCS  is a community-based longitudinal multiwave study of older men and women aged 65 or  above. Baseline survey and the follow-up surveys with replacement for deceased  elderly were conducted in eight longevity areas in China, which cover the northern,  middle and southern parts of China. Between 2008 and 2017, 6333 participants were  included in HABCS, comprising 1385 centenarians, 1350 nonagenarians, 1294  octogenarians, 1577 younger elderly (aged 65-79). FINDINGS TO DATE: We have found  that higher baseline levels of (1) total cholesterol, (2) low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C) and (3) superoxide dismutase activity were associated with  greater cognitive decline. While (4) higher LDL-C level was associated with lower  risk of all-cause mortality. There was a reverse association between (5) plasma  vitamin D and cognitive impairment in cross-sectional and prospective study. FUTURE  PLANS: We are currently exploring the relationships between various biomarkers and  different outcomes such as cognitive function and mortality. This longitudinal  cohort study will be continued in the future.","2019-10-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:46","","e026513","","10","9","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

L.","Theory and Design of the Community for successful ageing (ComSA) program in Singapore: connecting BioPsychoSocial health and quality of life experiences of  older adults.","BMC geriatrics","","1471-2318","10.1186/s12877-019-1277-x","","Background: Despite the emphasis on holistic health promotion in community programs for older people, few studies explicitly consider how BioPsychoSocial (BPS) health elements are interconnected and function to improve Quality of Life (QoL). The Community for Successful Ageing (ComSA) program in Singapore focuses on Community Development (CD) initiatives for older people, accounting for BPS theory in its design and content. Biological (B) health is conceived as physiological and cognitive functioning and related biological self-care; Psychological (P) health as feelings of life satisfaction, and Social health (S) as perceived social support and civic engagement. Furthermore, three overlapping sub-constructs are theorized to connect these elements. Namely Bio-Psychological (BP) health in terms of self-perceptions of ageing; the Psycho-Social (PS) aspects of interpersonal communication; and the Socio-Communal (SC) health in terms of civic engagement. BPS health is conceived as distinct from QoL, defined as composed of control, autonomy, self-realisation and pleasure (measured by CASP-19) of the older person. We examined 1) interconnections of BPS constructs and related sub-constructs and 2) their associations with QoL to inform a practical, applied program theory.Methods: A baseline survey (n = 321) of program participants (Mean = 70 years, SD = 8.73). All continuous variables were binarized as 'high' if the scores were above the median. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess 1) the adjusted effect of each BPS construct on CASP-19, and 2) the odds of scoring high on one BPS construct with the odds of scoring high on a related sub-construct (e.g. B and BP health).Results: The strongest relationship with QoL was markedly with BP self-perceptions of ageing (OR = 4.07, 95%CI = 2.21-7.49), followed by P life satisfaction (OR = 3.66, 95%CI = 2.04-6.57), PS interpersonal communication (OR = 2.42, 95%CI = 1.23-4.77), SC civic engagement (OR = 1.94, 95%CI = 1.05-3.57), and S social support (OR = 1.89, 95%CI = 1.06-3.38). Core B, P and S health were closely associated with their sub-constructs.Conclusion: ComSA CD is tightly coupled to its proposed program theory. It offers classes to improve B self-care and BP self-perceptions of ageing, group-based guided autobiography to improve P life-satisfaction and PS interpersonal communication, and community initiatives that encourage seniors to solve community issues. This holistic approach is likely to enhance ageing experiences and QoL.","2019-10-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:27:23","","254","","1","19","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31594545  PMCID: PMC6784337","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Social Support; *Older adults; Singapore; Singapore/epidemiology; Environment; Independent Living/*psychology; *Quality of life; Quality of Life/*psychology; *Environment Design; *Surveys and Questionnaires; *BioPsychoSocial programs; *Holistic conceptualization of health; Aging/psychology; Family/psychology; Healthy Aging/physiology/*psychology; Self Care/methods/psychology; Support, Psychosocial; Community Living -- Psychosocial Factors; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Family -- Psychosocial Factors; Self Care -- Methods; Self Care -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study utilized a population-based  cohort study of independent Japanese adults aged ≥65 years, which was a 6 year  follow-up of participants in the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study. A total of  31,273 respondents were extracted. Food store availability was evaluated based on  the existence of food stores within 500/1000 m of the home. We utilized  participant-reported subjective measurement as well as geographic information  system-based objective measurement for the evaluation. The incidence of disability  was determined using municipal data on eligibility for long-term care insurance  benefits. There were 7643 (24.4%) community-dwelling participants with low  subjective food store availability and 5673 (18.1%) with low objective food store  availability. During the follow-up period of 6 years, the cumulative incidence of  disability was 20.9%, with a significant association between low subjective food  store availability and increased disability. Participants who reported low  subjective food store availability had a significantly higher likelihood of  developing disability (hazard ratio = 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.25) than  those who reported high subjective food store availability after adjusting for age,  sex, sociodemographic status, environmental status, walking and going out, dietary  food intake, body mass index, and comorbidities. Low subjective food store  availability was associated with early onset of disability. Accessibility of food  stores might contribute to maintaining a disability-free life.","2019-10-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","10","11","","Nutrients","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31590318  PMCID: PMC6835243","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Japan; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; *Healthy Aging; *Independent Living; *Risk Reduction Behavior; *Food Supply; Social Determinants of Health; Geriatric Assessment/methods; *Disabled Persons; Disability Evaluation; *Commerce; *Healthy Lifestyle; food environment; food stores; functional disability; Residence Characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such findings give rise to the possibility that anatomical  connectivity via dorsal white matter may be associated with difficulties in name  retrieval in midlife. OBJECTIVES & METHOD: Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we  examined in vivo microstructural properties of white matter in 72 cognitively  healthy Middle-Aged (MA) and 59 Young Adults (YA), comparing their naming abilities  as well as testing, for possible associations between dorsal white matter integrity  and naming abilities in the MA group. RESULTS: The MA group was better in retrieving  correct names (U = 1525.5, p = .006), but they also retrieved more incorrect names  than YA believing they had retrieved the correct ones (U = 1265.5, p < .001).  Furthermore, despite being more familiar with the tested names than YA (U = 930, p <  .001), MA experienced significantly more TOTs relative to YA (U = 1498.5, p = .004).  Tract-based spatial statistics showed significant group differences in values of  fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity,  and mode of anisotropy in a range of white matter tracts. In the MA group, FA values  in the right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF) were positively correlated with  ""don't know"" scores (rs = .287, p = .014). CONCLUSION: The association of SLF  integrity and name retrieval ability in midlife indicates a need to revisit the  models of name retrieval that posit no role for dorsal white matter in proper name  retrieval.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:48:49","","55-61","","1","12","","Curr Aging Sci","","","","","","","","English","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","PMID: 31589112  PMCID: PMC7059877","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Young Adult; Mental Recall; Healthy Aging/*physiology; Anisotropy; *cortical areas; *Diffusion tensor imaging; *Mental Recall; *name retrieval; *superior longitudinal fasciculus; *tip-of-the-tongue states; *white matter.; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods; Memory Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Names; White Matter/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Diffusion tensor imaging; Healthy Aging -- physiology; White Matter -- diagnostic imaging; White Matter -- pathology; cortical areas; Diffusion Tensor Imaging -- methods; Memory Disorders -- diagnosis; Memory Disorders -- epidemiology; name retrieval; superior longitudinal fasciculus; tip-of-the-tongue states; white matter.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the  relationship between the production of these memories in normal aging and the  ability to integrate new information into existing knowledge in memory (i.e.,  updating). METHOD: Older participants were asked to perform an updating task as well  as to retrieve autobiographical memories that were later analyzed for their  self-defining relevance. RESULTS: Analyses showed significant positive correlations  between updating and the production of self-defining memories. CONCLUSION: Updating  our life story is an important psychological process,which enables us to refine and  enrich our life story with new experiences, roles and/or challenges, and this  ability seems to be related to the capacity to produce memories that draw on the  pursuit of long-term goals, meaning making, emotional regulation, and/or activation  of self-images (i.e., self-defining memories). These findings suggest that updating  one's identity throughout life, at least in normal aging, may be related to the  shaping and retrieval of self-defining memories, memories that lead to the creation  of narrative scripts, which themselves serve as the ingredients for ""chapters""  across the lifespan.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:00:44","","43-48","","1","12","","Curr Aging Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.","","","","","","PMID: 31589111  PMCID: PMC6971892","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; Memory; Prospective Studies; Memory, Short-Term -- physiology; *Aging; *normal aging; *Quality of Life; Self Concept; Healthy Aging/*psychology; *autobiographical memory; *executive function; *Memory, Episodic; *self-defining memories; *updating.; Executive Function/*physiology; Memory, Long-Term/physiology; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Memory, Episodic; Healthy Aging -- psychology; Executive Function -- physiology; autobiographical memory; executive function; Memory, Long-Term -- physiology; Mental Recall -- physiology; normal aging; self-defining memories; updating.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speckle-tracking echocardiography can unmask subclinical cardiac dysfunction.Objectives: This study investigated the impact of healthy aging on left ventricular (LV), right ventricular (RV), and left atrial (LA) performance and their relationship with serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in a sample of the general population without prevalent cardiovascular risk factors and structural heart disease.Methods: Speckle-tracking echocardiography was performed to assess LV global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), RV free wall strain, and LA phasic strain in 481 normal weight healthy participants who underwent extensive cardiovascular examination. Elevated BNP was defined as BNP >37.82 pg/ml for men and >50.86 pg/ml for women, which was the 90th percentile of BNP value distribution in the study population.Results: Mean age was 60 ± 12 years (range: 24 to 86 years), and 46% of the participants were men. The earliest alteration of age-related cardiac performance was observed in LA reservoir and conduit strain starting from decade 5, followed by elevated E/e' from decade 6. LVGLS decreased starting from decade 7, whereas there were no significant differences in RV strain, LV ejection fraction, or LV mass index across the decades. In the multivariable linear regression analyses, age was an independent predictor of decreased LVGLS (standardized β = 0.21; p < 0.001) and decreased LA phasic strain (standardized β = -0.40 and -0.61 for reservoir and conduit strain; both p < 0.001). Age and LA strain were significantly associated with elevated BNP values (adjusted odds ratios: 1.10 and 0.93; both p < 0.05, respectively), independent of ventricular morphology and function.Conclusions: Decreases in LA reservoir and conduit strain are the earliest markers of age-related cardiac remodeling, and LA reservoir strain is an independent predictor of elevated serum BNP level, with both possibly being markers of increased risk of heart failure in older adults.","2019-10-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:31:40","","1789-1800","","14","74","","J Am Coll Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Methods We used survey data from 12,432 participants of the 1921–26 birth cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health from 1996 (age 70–75) to 2016 (age 90–95). Repeated measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) identified trajectories of the development of disease with or without disability and according to longevity. Bivariate analyses and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the association between participants' baseline characteristics and membership of the latent classes. Results Over one-third of women could be considered to be successful agers when in their early 70s, few women could still be classified in this category throughout their later life or by the end of the study when they were in their 90s (~1%). RMLCA identified six trajectory groups including managed agers long survivors (9.0%) with disease but little disability, usual agers long survivors (14.9%) with disease and disability, usual agers (26.6%) and early mortality (25.7%). A small group of women having no major disease or disability well into their 80s were identified as successful agers (5.5%). A final group, missing surveys (18.3%), had a high rate of non-death attrition. Groups were differentiated by a number of social and health factors including marital status, education, smoking, body mass index, exercise and social support. Conclusions The study shows different trajectories of disease and disability in a cohort of ageing women, over time and through to very old ages. While some women continue into very old age with no disease or disability, many more women live long with disease but little disability, remaining independent beyond their capacity to be classified as successful agers.","2019-11-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:52:05","","803-810","","6","48","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

Women reported their own and their parents' birth years, and parental ages at childbirth were calculated and categorized as <25, 25-29, 30-34, or ≥35 years.Results: Women were aged on average 71.3 (standard deviation 2.7; range 65-79) years at baseline. There was no significant association of maternal age at childbirth with healthy survival to age 90 or death before age 90. Women born to fathers aged ≥35 compared with 30-34 years at their births were more likely to achieve healthy than usual survival (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00-1.32).

METHODS: The study uses data from a  nationally representative sample of 9,208 older people aged 60 and older collected  through the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) conducted in  2014 and 2015. RESULTS: Older people who were bullied in childhood have more severe  depressive symptoms and are more likely to be dissatisfied with life than those  without the experience of bullying victimization. The negative impacts remain  significant after childhood confounders (15 types of familial adversities), four  groups of contemporary confounders (demographic, health, social support, and  socioeconomic factors), and community-level unobserved heterogeneity are all  controlled for. The negative impacts of bullying victimization on mental health are  attenuated among people in very old age, which confirms the socioemotional  selectivity theory. DISCUSSION: The consequences of bullying victimization for  mental health are comparable to, or even greater than those of familial adversities  and contemporary risk factors. The factors threatening mental health vary  considerably for older people in different age groups. Effective anti-bullying  schemes in childhood and personalized support in later life can make a substantial  contribution to healthy aging.","2021-01-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","161-172","","1","76","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

While poor decision making has been linked  with increased risk of mortality, age-related cognitive decline, and dementia, less  is known regarding its associations with chronic disease indicators. We investigated  the associations of decision making with blood pressure (BP) values [i.e., SBP, mean  arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP), separately] in a community-based  cohort study of aging. METHODS: Participants were 908 nondemented older adults (age  ∼81 years; 75% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Decision making was  measured using questions designed to simulate materials used in financial and  healthcare settings in the real world and yielded a total score and domain-specific  health and financial decision making scores. Two seated and one standing BP  measurement were taken with all three contributing to average SBP, MAP that is,  [SBP + (2 × DBP)]/3, and PP, that is, SBP - DBP. Participants were queried about  hypertension status and antihypertension medications were visually inspected and  coded. Participants also underwent medical history and cognitive assessments.  RESULTS: In separate multivariable linear regression models, total decision making  scores were inversely associated with SBP, MAP, and PP after adjusting for age, sex,  education, antihypertension medication use, diabetes, and cumulative cardiovascular  disease burden (P values = 0.03). Decision making remained associated with these BP  values after additional adjustment for global cognition. CONCLUSION: Poorer decision  making is associated with higher BP values in nondemented older adults.","2020-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:54:37","","59-64","","1","38","","J Hypertens","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31503136  PMCID: PMC7233448","","","","Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Blood Pressure -- physiology; Hypertension -- drug therapy; Hypertension -- epidemiology; Cognitive Dysfunction; Blood Pressure/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Antihypertensive Agents/therapeutic use; Decision Making/*physiology; Hypertension/drug therapy/epidemiology; Antihypertensive Agents; Antihypertensive Agents -- therapeutic use; Decision Making -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examined the association between the frequency and duration of tea drinking and depressive symptoms of older adults by gender and age groups, based on a nationally representative sample in China.Method: The study employed the panel data from 2005, 2008/2009, 2011/2012 and 2014 waves of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We used the frequency and consistency of tea drinking behaviors to identify four types of tea consumption amongst Chinese seniors. Depressive symptoms were assessed by a five-item scale. Linear mixed effects models were applied.Results: We found that consistent and frequent tea-drinking was associated with significantly less depressive symptoms, and such impact was partially mediated by socioeconomic status, health behavior, physical health, cognitive function, and social engagement. However, the association was only significant for males and the oldest-old, rather than females and younger elders.Conclusions: Consistent and frequent tea-drinking may effectively reduce the risk of depressive symptoms for the Chinese elderly. The promotion of the traditional lifestyle of tea drinking could be a cost-effective way towards healthy aging for China.","2019-09-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:45:18","","246","","1","19","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31484503  PMCID: PMC6724308","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Social Class; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; China; *Chinese; China/epidemiology; Cognition/physiology; *Life Style; *Elderly; Healthy Aging/physiology/*psychology; *Depressive symptom; *Tea; Depression/diet therapy/*epidemiology/*psychology; Random Allocation; Middle Age; Depression -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Depression -- Diet Therapy; Random Assignment; Tea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first research objective was to  evaluate diet quality assessed by Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) of United States African  American and White adults (n = 2066), examined at baseline and two follow-up waves  in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS)  study. The sample was split into cohorts by age at study baseline: Younger, <50, and  older, ≥50 years. The second objective was to assess the association of MAR and risk  for malnutrition in adults who were ≥60 years at wave 4 (n = 746). The Mini  Nutritional Assessment was used to determine risk for malnutrition. At each of the  three study waves, 17 micronutrients from two 24 h dietary recalls were used to  calculate MAR. Over 13 years MAR changed minimally in the younger cohort as they  aged from early to middle adulthood. In contrast, a statistically significant  decline in MAR was observed for the older cohort between baseline (2004-2009) and  wave 4 (2013-2017), with a greater degree of worsening at low energy levels. The  risk for malnutrition was significantly associated with consuming a diet low in  energy, lower protein as a percent of energy at baseline, as well as being food  insecure, a current smoker, and having income <125% poverty. The risk for  malnutrition was not associated with a change in protein intake in years prior to  age 60, change in MAR scores across waves, MAR at wave 4, age, sex, race, or having  hypertension or diabetes. These longitudinal study findings revealed that diet  quality was not predictive of risk for malnutrition.","2019-09-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","9","11","","Nutrients","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31480661  PMCID: PMC6770204","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Risk Assessment; Poverty; *Malnutrition; African American; Diabetes Mellitus; diet quality; Diet/*standards; Hypertension; malnutrition; MNA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explored the relationship between  cross-sectional structural brain-imaging derived phenotypes (IDPs) and cognitive  ability, demographic, health and lifestyle factors (non-IDPs). Participants were  recruited from the 1953 Danish Male Birth Cohort (N=193). Applying an extreme group  design, members were selected in 2 groups based on cognitive change between IQ at  age ~20y (IQ-20) and age ~57y (IQ-57). Subjects showing the highest (n=95) and  lowest (n=98) change were selected (at age ~57) for assessments on multiple IDPs and  non-IDPs. We investigated the relationship between 453 IDPs and 70 non-IDPs through  pairwise correlation and multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA) models.  Significant pairwise associations included positive associations between IQ-20 and  gray-matter volume of the temporal pole. CCA identified a richer pattern - a single  ""positive-negative"" mode of population co-variation coupling individual  cross-subject variations in IDPs to an extensive range of non-IDP measures (r =  0.75, P(corrected) < 0.01). Specifically, this mode linked higher cognitive  performance, positive early-life social factors, and mental health to a larger brain  volume of several brain structures, overall volume, and microstructural properties  of some white matter tracts. Interestingly, both statistical models identified IQ-20  and gray-matter volume of the temporal pole as important contributors to the  inter-individual variation observed. The converging patterns provide novel insight  into the importance of early adulthood intelligence as a significant marker of  late-midlife neural decline and motivates additional study.","2019-08-26","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","5943-5974","","16","11","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31480020  PMCID: PMC6738442","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Cognition/*physiology; *magnetic resonance imaging; *aging; Intelligence/physiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; *Life Style; *risk factors; Gray Matter/diagnostic imaging; *brain structure; *neurocognitive function; *Social Environment; Attention/physiology; Denmark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: This study  aimed to investigate how psychometric performance differs between individuals with a  high school versus college education (surrogate measures for medium and high  cognitive reserves) given the same level of brain pathology assessed using  quantitative structural MRI. METHODS: We used data from the Aging Brain:  Vasculature, Ischemia, and Behavior Study (ABVIB). Cognition was assessed using a  neuropsychological battery that included those contained in the National Alzheimer's  Coordinating Center (NACC) uniform data set. Participants with a medium and high  cognitive reserve were matched by level of structural MRI changes, gender, and age.  RESULTS: Matched-pair regression analyses indicated that individuals with a higher  education had a significantly better performance in recognition and verbal fluency  animals, working memory, and processing speed in complex tasks. Moreover, they had a  better performance in interference trails compared to individuals with a high school  education (medium cognitive reserve). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, given  the same level of brain pathology, individuals with a higher education (cognitive  reserve) benefit from a superior performance in semantic memory and executive  functioning. Differences in these cognitive domains may be key pathways explaining  how individuals with a high cognitive reserve are able to diminish dementia  symptomatology despite physical changes in the brain.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:10:36","","335-344","","4-6","47","","Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 S.

Loss of cognitive function is a feared age-associated condition and  growing public health concern. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of  dementia, has no curative therapies. Characterizing the relationships between risk  factors, biomarkers, and AD progression is critical for the development of effective  disease prediction, clinical intervention, and ultimately, disease prevention. The  Emory Healthy Aging Study (EHAS) and the Emory Healthy Brain Study (EHBS), which is  nested within EHAS, aim to further the understanding of healthy aging and the  pathogenesis of age-related illnesses in well-characterized, community-based  prospective cohorts and to identify biomarkers for the earliest manifestations of AD  for the facilitation of preventative interventions. The EHAS is an innovative,  longitudinal, web-based study enrolling English-speaking adults in the U.S. who  agree to be contacted for future studies. Using validated instruments, the annual  questionnaire enquires about demographics, socioeconomics, self-reported cognitive  function, personal and family medical history, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors.  Cognitive assessments are also obtained using an ambulatory device. Nested within  EHAS, the EHBS is enrolling up to 2,500 EHAS participants, 50-75 years old, who do  not have a diagnosis of AD, mild cognitive impairment, or any other memory disorder.  EHBS in-person, biennial study visits, include neuropsychological testing,  cardiovascular measures, retinal and brain imaging, biospecimen collection (blood,  cerebrospinal fluid, gut microbiome), and other assessments. Since spring 2016, EHAS  and EHBS have enrolled 12,500 and 863 participants with completed baseline  assessments, respectively. Data and biospecimens from EHBS participants will support  a broad range of AD biomarker discovery efforts, and follow-up of EHAS participants  will enable assessment of self-reported cognitive trajectories and accumulation of  incident cases of a variety of health conditions. The EHAS design supports the  interval deployment of new study instruments and targeted sampling for ancillary  studies. This project will increase our knowledge about healthy aging, improve our  understanding of risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementias, support  development of biomarkers, and facilitate studies of age-associated disorders  including AD.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:08:31","","187-200","","3-4","53","","Neuroepidemiology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 S.

These increases in pharyngeal area can negatively affect swallowing  function in healthy older adults (HOA). However, the presence of pharyngeal area  changes and their effects on swallowing function in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain  unknown. Therefore, we compared the pharyngeal area of people with PD to HOA to  determine if pharyngeal area changes were present in PD above and beyond what is  seen in HOA. Within PD, we also evaluated if and how an increase in pharyngeal area  affects swallowing kinematics, swallowing safety, and swallowing efficiency. A  secondary analysis of videofluoroscopic swallow studies was completed comparing 41  HOA and 40 people with PD. Measures of pharyngeal area, swallowing kinematics,  swallowing safety (penetration/aspiration), and swallowing efficiency (residue) were  analyzed. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine if pharyngeal  area was significantly different between the HOA and PD groups while controlling for  age, sex, and height. Regression analyses were used to examine if and how pharyngeal  area influenced swallowing kinematics, swallowing safety, and swallowing efficiency  in PD. Pharyngeal areas were significantly larger for people with PD when compared  to HOA (p = .008). An increase in pharyngeal area was associated with less  pharyngeal constriction (p = .022), shorter duration of airway closure (p = .017),  worse swallowing safety (p < .0005), and worse swallowing efficiency (p = .037).  This study revealed that pharyngeal areas are larger in people with PD when compared  to HOA, and that this increase in pharyngeal area is associated with maladaptive  changes to swallowing kinematics, residue, and penetration/aspiration. These  findings support the notion that pharyngeal muscle atrophy may be exacerbated in PD  above and beyond what is seen in normal, healthy aging group. Results from this  study highlight the need to consider pharyngeal muscle atrophy as a source for  swallowing dysfunction in PD, and as a potential treatment target for swallowing  rehabilitation.","2020-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","389-398","","2","35","","Dysphagia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31446478  PMCID: PMC7513198","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Case-Control Studies; Biomechanical Phenomena; *Parkinson’s disease; *Deglutition; *Dysphagia; *Healthy older adults; *Pharyngeal area; *Pharyngeal volume; *Swallowing; Cineradiography; Deglutition/*physiology; Healthy Aging/*pathology/*physiology; Parkinson Disease/*pathology/physiopathology; Pharynx/*pathology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the association between cardiovascular status  in midlife and physical functioning trajectories in old age. DESIGN: Prospective  cohort study. SETTING: Helsinki Businessmen Study. PARTICIPANTS: We studied white  men born between 1919 and 1934 in the Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS, initial n =  3490). MEASUREMENTS: Three CVD status groups were formed based on clinical  measurements carried out in 1974: signs of CVD (diagnosed clinically or with changes  in ECG, chronic disease present or used medication, n = 563); healthy and low CVD  risk (n = 593) and high CVD risk (n = 1222). Of them, 1560 men had data on physical  functioning from at least one of four data collection waves between 2000-2010. Ten  questions from the RAND-36 (SF-36) survey were used to construct physical  functioning trajectories with latent class growth mixture models. Mortality was  accounted for in competing risk models. RESULTS: A five-class solution provided the  optimal number of trajectories: ""intact,"" ""high stable,"" ""high and declining,""  ""intermediate and declining,"" and ""consistently low"" functioning. Compared with low  CVD risk, high CVD risk in midlife decreased the risk of being classified into the  intact (fully adjusted β = -3.98; standard error = 2.0; P = .046) relative to the  consistently low physical functioning trajectory.

For participants aged ≥ 50 years, healthy vascular aging (HVA) was defined as an absence of hypertension and a brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity < the mean + 2 standard deviations, which was determined from a reference sample of healthy participants aged < 30 years. The primary outcome was first stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). In total, 11,474 participants were enrolled. The prevalence of HVA decreased from 36.0% in participants aged 50-59 years to 4.7% in those aged ≥ 70 years. During a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the incidence of first stroke was 0.5% in the HVA group but was 2.6% in the Non-HVA group. After adjusting for confounding variables, HVA was associated with a 0.32-fold lower risk of first stroke compared to the Non-HVA group (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.56; p < 0.001). It thus appears that HVA reduced the risk of first stroke in a community-based Chinese population. This suggests that evaluation of vascular aging as part of public health screening may be useful for stroke risk assessment.","2019-08-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:41:34","","5807-5816","","15","11","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31422381  PMCID: PMC6710043","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Prevalence; Cardiovascular Diseases -- epidemiology; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Blood Pressure; Hypertension -- epidemiology; Multivariate Analysis; China/epidemiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; Hypertension/epidemiology; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology; *arterial stiffness; *healthy vascular aging; *pulse wave velocity; *stroke; Ankle Brachial Index; Pulse Wave Analysis; Stroke/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology; Vascular Stiffness; stroke; pulse wave velocity; arterial stiffness; China -- epidemiology; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Stroke -- epidemiology; healthy vascular aging; Stroke -- etiology; Stroke -- physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  little is known regarding the social determinants of inflammation in low- and  middle-income countries. This study investigated the association between  socio-economic status and C-reactive protein (CRP) in England and Indonesia.  METHODS: This study used data from 4923 respondents aged 50+ in the English  Longitudinal Study of Ageing and from 1812 respondents from the Indonesian Family  Life Survey at baseline. The sources of information on individuals' education  attainment, wealth, CRP and other covariates were ELSA Waves 2, 4 and 6, and IFLS  Waves 4 and 5. Linear mixed models were performed to identify the longitudinal  relationships between socio-economic status and CRP, and joint models were used to  deal with bias in longitudinal ageing surveys due to attrition. RESULTS: Respondents  with high school education (β = -0.036, p < 0.01) or college degree or higher  (β = -0.127, p < 0.01) in England had lower CRP levels. Being wealthy is correlated  with lower CRP levels in England (middle: β = -0.073, p < 0.01; wealthiest:  β = -0.133, p < 0.01). Being wealthy and having higher education were related with  higher level of CRP in Indonesia. However, those significant relationships vanished  when health behaviour and health status were included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS:  The relationships between socio-economic status and CRP proved to be different in  England and Indonesia. Encouraging healthy lifestyles among older adults with low  socio-economic status may be the main focus of efforts toward healthy ageing in  England and other developed countries. However, in Indonesia and other developing  countries, attention is also required to older adults in wealthier socio-economic  groups.","2019-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","122-128","","","82","","Brain Behav Immun","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To date, no study has  investigated the link between a posteriori nutrient patterns based on food intake,  and cognitive decline in longitudinal analyses. The aim of this study was to  evaluate the relationship between nutrient patterns and cognitive function and  decline in two longitudinal cohorts of older persons from France and Canada. The  study sample was composed of participants from the Three-City study (3C, France) and  the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge, Quebec,  Canada). Both studies estimated nutritional intakes at baseline, and carried out  repeated measures of global cognitive function for 1,388 and 1,439 individuals,  respectively. Nutrient patterns were determined using principal component analysis  methodology in the two samples, and their relation with cognitive function and  decline was estimated using linear mixed models. In 3C, a healthy nutrient pattern,  characterized by higher intakes of plant-based foods, was associated with a higher  global cognitive function at baseline, as opposed to a Western nutrient pattern,  which was associated with lower cognitive performance. In NuAge, we also found a  healthy nutrient pattern and a Western pattern, although no association was observed  with either of these patterns in the Canadian cohort. No association between any of  the nutrient patterns and cognitive decline was observed in either cohort. There is  a need for longitudinal cohorts focusing on nutrient patterns with substantial  follow-up, in order to evaluate more accurately associations between nutrition and  cognition in older persons.","2019-08-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:25:58","","","","8","11","","Nutrients","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31387312  PMCID: PMC6723709","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; France; Longitudinal Studies; Time Factors; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Cognition -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Human; aging; cognition; Vegetables; France/epidemiology; *Diet, Healthy; *Cognition; Nutritive Value; Canada; Canada/epidemiology; *Nutritional Status; Nutrition; *Feeding Behavior; Cognitive Aging/*psychology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology; diet; nutrients; nutrition; principal component analysis; Food Intake; Factor Analysis; Food Habits; Nutrients; Cognition Disorders -- Risk Factors; Plants, Edible","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the association between diet quality and mortality in older people,  those aged 80 years and older, is understudied. Therefore, we conducted a  prospective study to examine whether better diet quality, assessed by a validated  dietary screening tool (DST), was associated with lower mortality in those aged 80  years and older. METHODS: Our study included 1990 participants (812 men and 1178  women), with a mean age of 84.1 years at baseline (ranging from 80 to 102 years  old), from the Geisinger Rural Aging Study longitudinal cohort in Pennsylvania.  Baseline descriptive information was obtained in 2009, and the DST was administered  via mailed survey. The DST is composed of 25 food- and behavior-specific questions  associated with dietary intake that generate a diet quality score ranging from 0  (lowest) to 100 (highest). Death was identified using electronic medical record and  the Social Security Death Index data. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence  intervals (CIs) across three diet quality categories were calculated by using Cox  proportional hazards models after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Over  8 years of follow-up (October 2009-February 2018), 931 deaths were documented.  Higher diet quality was associated with lower mortality risk (P-trend = .04).  Participants with high diet quality (defined as DST scores >75) had significantly  lower risk of mortality compared with those with low diet quality (defined as DST  scores <60) after adjusting for potential risk factors (adjusted HR = 0.76; 95% CI =  0.59-0.97). CONCLUSION: Diet quality, assessed by DST, is significantly associated  with risk of mortality in older adults aged 80 years and older in our prospective  cohort. Our results indicate that nutrition may have an important role in healthy  aging, and more studies are needed to develop appropriate dietary recommendations  for older persons.

Moreover, high-quality neighborhoods may serve as a supportive resource, potentially  ""buffering"" against the harmful influence of experiences such as discrimination or  depression that could otherwise erode adults' sense of belonging. This study  examines longitudinal associations of perceived neighborhood quality, daily  discrimination, and depression with social integration among midlife and older  adults, and tests whether perceived neighborhood quality is of increased importance  with age and/or in the contexts of discrimination and depression. RESEARCH DESIGN  AND METHODS: Multilevel random intercept models analyzed 6,016 observations of 3,102  individuals drawn from the 3 waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development in  the United States (MIDUS, 1995-2014). RESULTS: Perceived neighborhood quality was  associated with greater social integration throughout adulthood, though its impact  was slightly attenuated with age. Moreover, depression was harmful for social  integration across the age range, yet its influence was significantly buffered by  perceived neighborhood quality. Daily discrimination was not associated with social  integration, net of covariates. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings underscore the  importance of physical place and person-environment fit for social well-being  throughout adulthood, and confirm the deleterious effects of depression for adults'  social integration. Further, results highlight perceived neighborhood quality as a  critical component for successful ""aging in place,"" particularly as a social  resource adults may call upon in the context of depression.","2020-05-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:51:27","","661-671","","4","60","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

Age is the strongest non-modifiable risk factor but it is estimated that over half of  CRC cases are linked with lifestyle factors such as diet. The Biomarkers Of RIsk of  Colorectal Cancer (BORICC) Study recruited 363 participants in 2005 to investigate  the effects of lifestyle factors on biomarkers of CRC risk. AIM: In the present  BORICC Follow-Up (BFU) Study, we are using a longitudinal study design to  investigate the effects of ageing (12+ years) and lifestyle factors on biomarkers of  CRC risk and on healthy ageing. METHODS: BFU Study participants attended a study  visit at North Tyneside General Hospital (UK) for collection of biological samples,  including blood and rectal biopsies, and information collected included  anthropometric measurements, a Health & Medications Questionnaire, physical activity  and sedentary behaviour, and habitual diet. Furthermore, musculoskeletal function  was assessed by heel bone densitometry, timed up and go and hand grip strength as  markers of healthy ageing. The BFU Study outcomes will be similar to those measured  at baseline in the BORICC Study, such as DNA methylation and mitochondrial function,  with additional measurements including the gut microbiome, faecal short-chain fatty  acid concentrations and expression of genes associated with CRC. RESULTS:  Participants' recruitment to BFU Study and all sample and data collection have been  completed. Forty-seven of the original BORICC participants were re-recruited to the  BFU Study (mean age 67 years, 51% female). The recruits included 37 initially  healthy participants and 10 participants who had adenomatous polyps at baseline.  Approximately 70% of participants were over-weight or obese. CONCLUSION: Ultimately,  identifying lifestyle factors that can reduce CRC risk, and understanding the  underlying mechanisms for the effects of lifestyle and ageing on CRC risk, could  lead to early prevention strategies.","2019-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","231-238","","3","25","","Nutr Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31370734","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Age Factors; Biomarkers; ageing; United Kingdom/epidemiology; biomarkers; Colorectal cancer risk; Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology; Diet/methods/statistics & numerical data; longitudinal study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Capabilities refers to the extent  to which older people are free to make choices that are important to them. At  present, it is not known how purpose in life interacts with capabilities to  influence quality of life for those living with a disability. This study examined  the extent to which purpose in life and capabilities interacts with health status to  affect quality of life, particularly for older people with a disability.Methods:  Self-report data from participants in a longitudinal cohort study of older New  Zealanders were analyzed. Responses from 452 older people with a disability were  compared with 3299 age- and gender-matched older people without a disability on  indicators related to health and aging. The associations were tested using  hierarchical regression. Mediational impact of purpose in life and capabilities were  tested via path analysis.Results: Mental health, physical health, purpose in life,  and capabilities accounted for a significant amount of variance in quality of life  for older people with a disability. Purpose in life and capabilities were  significant unique mediators for older people with a disability.Conclusions: Purpose  in life may help older people with a disability to deal with early onset stressors  or changes in mental and physical health to maintain overall quality of life. The  role of capabilities suggests that the social environment and access to resources  and choices are important in ensuring that older people aging with or into a  disability achieve quality of life in a socially just environment.Implications for  rehabilitationsPurpose in life and capability are unique mediators of the  relationship between health status and quality of life.Purpose in life may act as an  effective buffering mechanism to deal with disability in later life while capability  can empower older people with a disability to achieve quality of life in a just  environment.The notion of successful aging with disability should be re-defined as  using psychological, social support, and healthcare resources to live a life  consistent with personal values in the context of disabilityRather than emphasizing  structural factors and physical functioning in activity participation, older people  with disability should be supported to decide and pursue their own  preferences.Rehabilitation professionals can work flexibly with older people with  disability to maximize their resilience, dignity, autonomy and choice, and positive  connection to others.","2021-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:09:25","","181-191","","2","43","","Disabil Rehabil","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31335217","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Multiple Regression; Scales; Self Report; *Quality of Life; New Zealand; *quality of life; Loneliness; *Disabled Persons; *aging and disability; *capabilities; *Older people; *purpose in life; Depression; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Community Living; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Functional Status; Data Analysis Software; Attitude to Aging; Attitude to Disability; Attitude to Life; Disabled -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Old Age; Life Purpose; Matched Case Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using blood pressure, memory, pulmonary function, grip strength, and metabolic measures (body mass index, waist circumference and fasting levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, lipids, and inflammatory markers), offspring were ranked according to relative health using gender-, age-, and relevant confounder-adjusted z-scores. Based on our prior work, families met a healthy aging phenotype if ≥ 2 and ≥ 50% of their offspring were exceptionally healthy for that respective phenotype. Among 426 families, only two families met criteria for three healthy aging phenotypes and none met criteria for four or more healthy aging phenotypes. Using Spearman correlation, the proportion of offspring within families with exceptionally healthy pulmonary function was correlated with the proportion of offspring within families with exceptional strength (r = 0.19, p = 0.002). The proportion of offspring within families meeting the healthy blood pressure and metabolic phenotypes were also correlated (r = 0.14, p = 0.006), and more families were classified as meeting healthy blood pressure and metabolic phenotypes (Kappa = 0.10, p = 0.02), as well as the healthy pulmonary and blood pressure phenotypes than expected by chance (Kappa = 0.09, p = 0.03). Other phenotypes were weakly correlated (|r| ≤ 0.07) with low pairwise agreement (Kappa ≤ 0.06). Among these families selected for familial longevity, correspondence between healthy aging phenotypes was weak, supporting the heterogeneous nature of longevity and suggesting biological underpinnings of each individual phenotype should be examined separately to determine their shared and unique determinants.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:07:00","","383-393","","4","41","","Geroscience","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31332674  PMCID: PMC6815318","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Longevity -- physiology; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; United States; Insulin; Insulin -- blood; Memory -- physiology; Blood Pressure -- physiology; 9007-41-4; C-Reactive Protein; C-Reactive Protein -- analysis; Hand Strength -- physiology; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-6 -- blood; Family; Hand Strength/physiology; *Healthy aging; Phenotype; Healthy aging; Blood Pressure/physiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; *Phenotype; Denmark; *Familial longevity; Blood Glucose/analysis; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; Cholesterol, HDL/blood; Insulin/blood; Interleukin-6/blood; Longevity/physiology; Memory/physiology; Respiratory Physiological Phenomena; Triglycerides/blood; Waist Circumference/physiology; Blood Glucose; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Blood Glucose -- analysis; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, HDL -- blood; Familial longevity; Triglycerides; Triglycerides -- blood; Waist Circumference -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine  differences in predictive performance of high-degree nodes (""hubs"") and  high-centrality ones (""cores""), we implement four subsetting strategies (two  degree-based, two centrality-based) and obtain four surrogate sets of variables,  which we use as input features for machine learning models to predict the SAGE index  of subjects. All four models have variables belonging to the physical,  cardiovascular, cognitive and immunological domains among their fifteen most  important predictors. A fifth domain (leisure-time activities, LTA) is also present  in some form. From a comparison of the surrogate sets' size and predictive  performance, a centrality-based approach (selection of the most central  variable-nodes within each cluster) yielded the smallest-sized surrogate set, while  having high prediction accuracy (measured by its model's area-under-curve, AUC) in  comparison to its analogous degree-based strategy (selection of the highest-degree  nodes per cluster). Inclusion of the next most-central variables yielded negligible  changes in predictive performance while more than doubling the surrogate set size.  The centrality-based approach thus yields a surrogate set which offers a good  balance between number of variables and prediction performance, and can act as a  representative subset of the SLAS-2 clinical dataset.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0219186","","7","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31318894  PMCID: PMC6638841","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Longitudinal Studies; Singapore; Aging/*physiology; ROC Curve; *Algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We used data from the Comparative Outcomes And  Service Utilization Trends (COAST) study, a population-based cohort study of people  living with HIV (PLWH), to determine incidence rates of six key chronic diseases  among PLWH receiving HAART in BC from 2000 to 2012. The selected diseases included  cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN),  asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD)  and chronic liver disease (CLD) defined using ICD-9 and -10 codes. Disease incidence  was determined by number of new cases per year. We used Poisson regression to  measure trends in incidence rates. Results: The study sample (n = 10,210) was  predominantly male (83%), white (72%) and younger than 50 years of age at HAART  initiation (88%). Incidence rates of HTN per 1000 person-years (PY) increased  significantly between 2000 and 2012, after adjusting for age, sex, baseline-weighted  Charlson Comorbidity Index, CD4 cell count and viral load (p < .001); incidence  rates of CKD and CLD decreased significantly over time (p < .001). Unadjusted  incidence rates of DM increased over time (p < .01), but remained stable in the  adjusted model. Incidence rate patterns for CVD and COPD/asthma were stable over the  study period. Conclusions: Population-level increases in incidence rates for HTN,  and decreases for CLD and CKD, were observed among PLWH on modern  (pre-integrase-inhibitor) HAART from 2000 to 2012. Overall, the increasing incidence  of several of these chronic comorbidities in our study suggests that further efforts  are needed to maximize the potential for healthy aging among PLWH receiving modern  (pre-integrase-inhibitor) HAART.","2019-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1955-1963","","11","35","","Curr Med Res Opin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31315470","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Incidence; *epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/epidemiology; Comorbidity; Hypertension/epidemiology; *AIDS; *Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; *chronic disease; *highly active antiretroviral therapy; *HIV; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; HIV Infections/complications/*drug therapy; Liver Diseases/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimated three DNAm based EAA measures: (1) universal epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccel); (2) intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA); and (3) extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale total and sub-domain scores at baseline (2004-2009) and follow-up visits (2009-2013). Linear mixed-effects regression models were conducted, adjusting potentially confounding covariates, selection bias and multiple testing (N = 329 participants, ∼52% men, k = 1.9 observations/participant, mean follow-up time∼4.7 years).Results: None of the epigenetic age acceleration measures were associated with total depressive symptom scores at baseline or over time.

The Senior Exercise Park is outdoor exercise equipment designed specifically for use by older people that provides physical and social benefits for older people in the community, and has the potential to be used widely as a sustainable mode of physical activity. The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate the effects of sustained engagement through the use of a community-based novel outdoor physical activity program (purpose-built exercise park) for older people on physical, mental and social health and physical activity outcomes (the ENJOY project).Methods: This is a prospective pre-post design study with 12 months follow up. Adults aged ≥60 years will be recruited from the general community from the suburbs close to the Senior Exercise Parks locations in Melbourne. Participants will undergo a 12 week structured supervised physical activity program using the outdoor Senior Exercise Park equipment followed by 6 months unstructured physical activity program. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3, 9, and 12 months. The following outcomes will be assessed: physical activity, physical function, psychosocial and mental health outcomes, falls risk and falls occurrence, participants' feedback and satisfaction, and health care resource use.Discussion: The ENJOY trial is designed to operate in a community setting with local government engagement to maximise the usage of the exercise park and provide an outdoor space for older people to be physically active. This project will evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the outdoor exercise park on a range of health outcomes and its long-term usability in the community.Trial Registration: This trial is prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between affective  well-being, total life expectancy, and life expectancy free of disability and  chronic disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used data on  9761 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing who were followed up  for a maximum of 10 years (mean [SD] follow-up, 6 [3.7] years). Discrete-time  multistate life table models were used to estimate total life expectancy and life  expectancy free of disability or chronic disease. Data were collected between March  2002 and March 2013 and analyzed from December 2018 to April 2019. Analyses were  adjusted for wealth and cohabiting status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main  outcome was life expectancy free of disability and chronic disease. Affective  well-being was assessed at baseline as a combination of enjoyment of life and the  lack of significant depressive symptoms. Disability was measured in terms of  impaired activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, and  chronic disease as the occurrence of 6 serious illnesses. RESULTS: Data were  analyzed from 9761 participants (5297 [54%] female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 64  [9.9] years). High affective well-being was associated with longer life expectancy  and with longer disability-free and chronic disease-free life expectancies. For  example, a woman aged 50 years who reported high affective well-being could expect  to live 6 years longer than a woman of similar age with low well-being; 31.4 of her  remaining years (95% CI, 30.5-31.9 years) would be likely to be free of disability,  compared with 20.8 years (95% CI, 20.1-22.1 years) for a woman with low affective  well-being. A man aged 50 years with high affective well-being could expect to live  20.8 years (95% CI, 18.7-22.4 years) without chronic disease, compared with 11.4  years (95% CI, 8.5-14.6 years) for a man reporting low well-being. Similar patterns  were observed at the ages of 60, 70, and 80 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This  study suggests that people who report high levels of subjective well-being live  longer and also healthier lives than those with lower well-being. These findings add  weight to endeavors to promote the subjective well-being of older people.","2019-07-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:44:10","","e196870","","7","2","","JAMA Netw Open","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31290992  PMCID: PMC6624816","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Confidence Intervals; Life Expectancy; Personal Satisfaction; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Comparative Studies; Healthy Aging; *Longevity; *Quality of Life; *Healthy Aging/physiology/psychology; United Kingdom/epidemiology; *Life Expectancy; Chronic Disease; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; *Diagnostic Self Evaluation; *Mental Health; Disabled Persons/statistics & numerical data; Psychological Well-Being; Middle Age; Health Status -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Surveys; Data Analysis Software; Data Analysis, Statistical; Data Collection Methods; Disability-Adjusted Life Years; Disabled","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different etiologies have been suggested for nonlobar CMB, which have a stronger connection to hypertension (HT) than do lobar CMB. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CMB and the association between nonlobar/lobar CMB and different blood pressure (BP) and HT treatment conditions in a longitudinal, population-based cohort of the Good Aging in Skåne (GÅS) study. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), CMB, atrophies, and infarctions were identified with brain 3T MRI, and BP parameters were examined in 344 randomly selected subjects between 70 and 87 years old. CMB were observed in 26% of the whole cohort, increasing from 19% of subjects in their 70s to 30% of those over 80 years of age. Of these subjects, 38% had multiple CMB, and 59% had a lobar localization. CMB were associated with severe confluent WMH (odds ratio = 7.02; 2.16-18.84). Increasing age, being male, and having HT, impaired cognition, or a history of angina pectoris were associated with CMB. Both lobar and nonlobar CMB were associated with HT. Nonlobar CMB were particularly associated with increased BP, pulse pressure, controlled HT, and uncontrolled HT. After controlling for sex and HT, age was no longer a risk factor for CMB In conclusion, sex and HT are the major risk factors for CMB, especially nonlobar CMB, which suggests stricter implementation of recommended guidelines for HT treatment in the elderly.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:39:46","","1099-1107","","8","21","","J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors.

Regular assessments of physical activity  can help detect early health-related changes and manage physical activity targeted  interventions. The quantification of physical activity, however, is difficult as  commonly used self-reported measures are biased and rather unprecise point in time  measurements. Modern alternatives are commonly based on wearable technologies which  are accurate but suffer from usability and compliance issues. In this study, we  assessed the potential of an unobtrusive ambient-sensor based system for continuous,  long-term physical activity quantification. Towards this goal, we analysed one year  of longitudinal sensor- and medical-records stemming from thirteen  community-dwelling old and oldest old subjects. Based on the sensor data the daily  number of room-transitions as well as the raw sensor activity were calculated. We  did find the number of room-transitions, and to some degree also the raw sensor  activity, to capture numerous known associations of physical activity with  cognitive, well-being and motor health indicators and outcomes. The results of this  study indicate that such low-cost unobtrusive ambient-sensor systems can provide an  adequate approximation of older adults' overall physical activity, sufficient to  capture relevant associations with health indicators and outcomes.","2019-07-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9662","","1","9","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31273234  PMCID: PMC6609627","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Independent Living/*statistics & numerical data; *Exercise; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; *Self Report; Wearable Electronic Devices/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Childhood experiences, crucial for life course development of  mental health, may modify how neighbourhood affects subsequent depression. This  study assessed the longitudinal associations of access to services and neighbourhood  nuisance with depression among older adults, and tested whether these associations  varied by exposure to childhood stressors. Data were drawn from the cross-national  Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, a prospective cohort study  between 2004/2005 and 2015, representative for European adults over the age of 50.  Individual perceptions of neighbourhood were measured at baseline; childhood  stressors, defined as socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences and health  problems, were collected retrospectively. Multilevel logistic regression estimated  the risk of depression (n = 10,328). Access to services were negatively (OR = 0.78,  95% CI 0.68-0.90) and neighbourhood nuisance positively (OR = 1.36, 95% CI  1.18-1.56) associated with the probability of depression during follow-up. We found  interactions between neighbourhood and childhood socioeconomic conditions, but not  with adverse experiences and health problems. While older adults who grew up in  better childhood socioeconomic conditions benefited more from living in a  residential area with good access to services, they were at higher risk of  developing depression when residing in areas with more neighbourhood nuisances.  Older adults' mental health can benefit from better access to public transportation  and neighbourhood amenities, while physical and social problems in the local area  increase the risk of depression. Importantly, socioeconomic circumstances in early  life may influence vulnerability to neighbourhood effects in older age.","2019-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","105764","","","126","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The established Satisfaction with Life Scale was used to assess life satisfaction. The well-recognized Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was used to quantify positive and negative affect, respectively. A single-item measure was used to quantify sexual satisfaction, ranging from 1 to 5 (higher values correspond to higher sexual satisfaction). The analysis was stratified by sex and age group (40-59 years, 60 years and over).Results: The mean sexual satisfaction score was 3.4 (± 1.0) in men and 3.5 (± 0.9) in women. Fixed-effects regressions revealed that sexual satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction (total sample: β = .08, p < .001; men: β = .08, p < .001; women: β = .07, p < .001) and positive affect (total sample: β = .04, p < .001; men: β = .04, p < .001; women: β = .03, p < .01) as well as was negatively associated with negative affect (total sample: β = - .05, p < .001; men: β = - .05, p < .001; women: β = - .04, p < .001).Conclusion: This study emphasizes the longitudinal association between sexual satisfaction and subjective well-being both in men and women. Life satisfaction is associated with satisfaction with sex life in both age groups. We conclude that sexual satisfaction is a life domain related to life satisfaction among older men and women. Thus, maintaining or improvement of sexual satisfaction could have an impact on successful ageing. Research is required to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","2019-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:37:14","","3025-3035","","11","28","","Qual Life Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 31264125","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Personal Satisfaction; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; *Personal Satisfaction; Quality of Life/*psychology; Life satisfaction; Negative affect; Old age; Orgasm; Positive affect; Sexual Behavior/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Sexual satisfaction; Sexuality/*psychology; Subjective well-being; Sexuality; Middle Age; Regression; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent literature has questioned this assumption. Conceptualizing health as a multidimensional construct, encompassing physical disabilities, functional limitations, chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, memory problems, and self-rated health, we investigated patterns of health trajectories among middle-aged and older adults in the United States. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between self-perceptions of aging (SPAs) and health trajectory patterns. Research Design and Methods We used latent class growth modeling to examine health trajectory patterns, based on longitudinal data with 4 measurement points over a 7-year period from a national sample of 10,212 middle-aged and older adults (aged 51 and older). Multinomial logit models were used to examine how health trajectory patterns were associated with baseline SPA. Results We identified 4 health trajectory patterns: accelerated aging, usual aging, depressed aging, and healthy aging. The full model shows that with each one-unit increase in negative SPA, the odds of belonging to an accelerated aging group, depressed aging group, and usual aging group (vs healthy aging group) increased by 26%, 17%, and 9%, respectively. Discussion and Implications The combination of health changes across different domains results in health trajectories that cannot be understood as simply a declining process. SPAs are associated with individuals' trajectories of health.","2020-07-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:36:55","","841-850","","5","60","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

However,  there is increasing evidence that psychological, social, and cognitive factors also  help to maintain functional independence. This study compared the protective  associations between physical and social activities and disability onset. METHODS:  We analysed data from 5434 adults aged 50+ years tracked biennially from 2004/2005  to 2016/2017, measuring self-reported difficulty in carrying out any basic  activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs. Exposures included mild,  moderate and vigorous physical activity, frequency of socialising with  friends/family, cultural engagement (eg, going to the theatre/museums/concerts), and  participation in community groups. RESULTS: Over the 12-year follow-up, 1945 adults  developed disability. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for  all identified demographic and health-related variables, vigorous exercise or  activity once a month or more (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96), moderate exercise or  activity more than once a week (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.97) or cultural engagement  once or twice a year or more (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97) were associated with a  lower hazard of developing disability. Other exposures did not show independent  protective associations. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses considering  reverse causality and exploring the potential confounding role of time-invariant  factors, such as socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the  importance of either developing multimodal interventions to protect against  disability and promote healthy ageing or promoting greater physical and social  engagement with existing community activities among older adults.","2019-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:11:37","","906-912","","10","73","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

It is unclear if similar benefits exist in non-Mediterranean regions.  OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to examine associations between MedDiet  adherence and cognitive function in an older UK population and to investigate  whether associations differed between individuals with high compared with low  cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. METHODS: We conducted an analysis in 8009 older  individuals with dietary data at Health Check 1 (1993-1997) and cognitive function  data at Health Check 3 (2006-2011) of the European Prospective Investigation into  Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk (EPIC-Norfolk). Associations were explored between  MedDiet adherence and global and domain-specific cognitive test scores and risk of  poor cognitive performance in the entire cohort, and when stratified according to  CVD risk status. RESULTS: Higher MedDiet adherence defined by the Pyramid MedDiet  score was associated with better global cognition (β ± SE = -0.012 ± 0.002;  P < 0.001), verbal episodic memory (β ± SE = -0.009 ± 0.002; P < 0.001), and simple  processing speed (β ± SE = -0.002 ± 0.001; P = 0.013). Lower risk of poor verbal  episodic memory (OR: 0.784; 95% CI: 0.641, 0.959; P = 0.018), complex processing  speed (OR: 0.739; 95% CI: 0.601, 0.907; P = 0.004), and prospective memory (OR:  0.841; 95% CI: 0.724, 0.977; P = 0.023) was also observed for the highest compared  with the lowest Pyramid MedDiet tertiles. The effect of a 1-point increase in  Pyramid score on global cognitive function was equivalent to 1.7 fewer years of  cognitive aging. MedDiet adherence defined by the Mediterranean Diet Adherence  Screener (MEDAS) score (mapped through the use of both binary and continuous  scoring) showed similar, albeit less consistent, associations. In stratified  analyses, associations were evident in individuals at higher CVD risk only  (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to the MedDiet is associated with better  cognitive function and lower risk of poor cognition in older UK adults. This  evidence underpins the development of interventions to enhance MedDiet adherence,  particularly in individuals at higher CVD risk, aiming to reduce the risk of  age-related cognitive decline in non-Mediterranean populations.","2019-10-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","938-948","","4","110","","Am J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 31204785","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Nutrition Assessment; Adult; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; *healthy aging; *Cognition; *Mediterranean diet; *Diet, Mediterranean; *cognitive function; United Kingdom/epidemiology; *cardiovascular health; *cognitive decline; *dementia risk; Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their extended healthspans are poorly understood. To address  this question we carried out an eight-year longitudinal study of ageing in  long-lived bats (Myotis myotis). We deep-sequenced ~1.7 trillion base pairs of RNA  from 150 blood samples collected from known aged bats to ascertain the age-related  transcriptomic shifts and potential microRNA-directed regulation that occurred. We  also compared ageing transcriptomic profiles between bats and other mammals by  analysis of 298 longitudinal RNA sequencing datasets. Bats did not show the same  transcriptomic changes with age as commonly observed in humans and other mammals,  but rather exhibited a unique, age-related gene expression pattern associated with  DNA repair, autophagy, immunity and tumour suppression that may drive their extended  healthspans. We show that bats have naturally evolved transcriptomic signatures that  are known to extend lifespan in model organisms, and identify novel genes not yet  implicated in healthy ageing. We further show that bats' longevity profiles are  partially regulated by microRNA, thus providing novel regulatory targets and  pathways for future ageing intervention studies. These results further disentangle  the ageing process by highlighting which ageing pathways contribute most to healthy  ageing in mammals.","2019-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1110-1120","","7","3","","Nat Ecol Evol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31182815","","","","Humans; Animals; Longitudinal Studies; Longevity; Transcriptome; *Chiroptera; Mammals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary goals of this study were to describe the prevalence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and to investigate its association with in-hospital delirium. The authors hypothesized that delirium would be a significant risk factor for postoperative cognitive dysfunction during follow-up.Methods: This study used data from an observational study of cognitive outcomes after major noncardiac surgery, the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery study. Postoperative delirium was evaluated each hospital day with confusion assessment method-based interviews supplemented by chart reviews. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was determined using methods adapted from the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction. Associations between delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction were examined at 1, 2, and 6 months.Results: One hundred thirty-four of 560 participants (24%) developed delirium during hospitalization. Slightly fewer than half (47%, 256 of 548) met the International Study of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction-defined threshold for postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 1 month, but this proportion decreased at 2 months (23%, 123 of 536) and 6 months (16%, 85 of 528). At each follow-up, the level of agreement between delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction was poor (kappa less than .08) and correlations were small (r less than .16). The relative risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction was significantly elevated for patients with a history of postoperative delirium at 1 month (relative risk = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.67), but not 2 months (relative risk = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.72-1.64), or 6 months (relative risk = 1.21; 95% CI, 0.71-2.09).Conclusions: Delirium significantly increased the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the first postoperative month; this relationship did not hold in longer-term follow-up. At each evaluation, postoperative cognitive dysfunction was more common among patients without delirium. Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction may be distinct manifestations of perioperative neurocognitive deficits.","2019-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:19:25","","477-491","","3","131","","Anesthesiology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31166241  PMCID: PMC6692220","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Massachusetts -- epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Comorbidity; Cognitive Dysfunction/*epidemiology; Massachusetts/epidemiology; Delirium/*epidemiology; Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology; Massachusetts; Cognitive Dysfunction -- epidemiology; Delirium -- epidemiology; Postoperative Complications -- epidemiology; Retrospective Design; Delirium -- Epidemiology; Postoperative Complications -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, whether or not this  association extends to age-related cataract, 1 of the leading causes of visual  impairment, is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the  association between adherence to dietary guidelines, using total diet score, and  incidence of age-related cataract. METHODS: Of 3654 baseline participants of the  population-based Blue Mountains Eye Study cohort (1992-1994), 2334 (75.8% survivors)  and 1952 (76.7% survivors) were examined after 5 and 10 y, respectively. Cataract  was assessed from lens photographs using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System.  Baseline total diet score was calculated from FFQ data following a modified version  of the Healthy Eating Index for Australians. OR with 95% CI were estimated using  discrete logistic regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, and other  confounders. To test interaction, a cross-product term of 2 factors was included in  regression models. RESULTS: Of 2173 participants (84.7% of those returned for 1 or  both follow-ups) with total diet score estimated, 57% were women, mean baseline age  was 63.9 ± 8.4y, and mean baseline BMI was 26.3 ± 4.3 kg/m2. After multivariable  adjustment, baseline total diet score was not associated with incidence of any  cataract. A multiplicative interaction was observed between total diet score and BMI  for incident nuclear cataract (P-interaction = 0.04): increasing baseline total diet  score was associated with decreased risk of nuclear cataract among participants with  BMI <25 (per unit increased total diet score, OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.99;  P = 0.02), but not among participants with BMI ≥25 (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.10;  P = 0.95).

However,  little attention has been given to the role of adherence to national nutrition  guidelines in that context. This study aimed to investigate the prospective  association between adherence to the French nutrition guidelines and HA. The authors  analysed data from 21 407 participants of the NutriNet-Santé study with a median  baseline age of 55·6 years (2009-2014) and initially free of major chronic diseases.  HA was defined as not developing major chronic disease, no depressive symptoms, no  function-limiting pain, independence in instrumental activities of daily living,  good physical, cognitive and social functioning, as well as good self-perceived  health. Adherence to guidelines of the French Nutrition and Health Programme  (Programme National Nutrition Santé or PNNS) was measured via the PNNS Guideline  Score (PNNS-GS), using baseline data from repeated 24-h dietary records and physical  activity questionnaires. After a median follow-up of 5·7 years, 46·3 % of  participants met our HA criteria. Robust-error-variance Poisson regression revealed  that higher PNNS-GS scores, reflecting higher adherence to nutrition recommendations  (including both diet and physical activity guidelines), were associated with a  higher probability to age healthily (relative riskquartile 4 v. quartile 1 = 1·17  (95 % CI 1·12, 1·22)). Supplementary analyses revealed that this association may, to  a small part, be mediated by weight status. The results suggest that high adherence  to the French national nutrition recommendations may be linked to better overall  health throughout ageing.","2019-07-14","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:51:15","","93-102","","1","122","","Br J Nutr","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31162001","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Diet; Diet -- standards; France; Nutritional Status; Cohort Studies; *Healthy Aging; *Healthy ageing; *Diet; Nutrition Policy; Healthy Aging; *Epidemiology; Healthy ageing; Epidemiology; Diet/*standards; *Multidimensional concepts; *Nutrition Policy; Multidimensional concepts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlation analysis of the ratings in the BFS cognitive-mental function subdomain and total score on the IGD revealed that the highest correlations were achieved by the BFS parameters cognitive switching capability (r=-0.56, p < 0.001), strategic thinking (r=-0.49, p < 0.001), changeover capability (r=-0.50, p < 0.001) and stepping-stone-maze test (r=-0.51, p < 0.001).Conclusions: Ratings on the BFS cognitive-mental function subdomain correlated well with scores on a validated questionnaire for cognition assessment, the IGD. Therefore, the BFS/BFA assessment tool meets the needs of the EIP-AHA.","2019-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:35:07","","27-32","","","125","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The sample included 1,911  married and cohabiting respondents aged 57 to 85 at the baseline survey. We examined  four factors related to partnered sex: being sexually active, sexual frequency,  feeling okay with sexual frequency, and sexual quality. Mental health was measured  by self-rated poor mental health, unhappiness, and psychological distress. The  relationship quality measures considered both relationship support and relationship  strain. RESULTS: Results from mixed-effects models suggest that being sexually  active, having sex more frequently, feeling okay with sexual frequency, and  reporting better sexual quality were all related to better mental health outcomes.  Relationship quality partially explained the effects of sex on mental health.  DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of sex for mental health and  relationship quality among older adults.

This study examines associations between lifestyle  behavioral factors and multimorbidity resilience (MR) among older adults. METHODS:  Using baseline data from the Comprehensive Cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study  on Aging, we studied 6,771 Canadian adults aged 65 or older who reported two or more  of 27 chronic conditions, and three multimorbidity clusters:  cardiovascular/metabolic, osteo-related, and mental health. Associations were  explored using hierarchical linear regression modeling, controlling for  sociodemographic, social/environmental, and illness context covariates. RESULTS:  Among older adults with two or more illnesses, as well as the  cardiovascular/metabolic and osteo-related illness clusters, having a non-obese body  mass, being a non-smoker, satisfaction with quality of sleep, having a good  appetite, and not skipping meals are associated with MR. However, the mental-health  cluster resulted in different behavioral lifestyle associations, where MR was not  associated with obesity, smoking, or appetite, but inactivity demonstrated moderate  positive associations with MR. DISCUSSION: While there are similar patterns of  lifestyle behaviors across multimorbidity and multimorbidity clusters involving  physiological chronic illnesses, those associated with mental health are distinct.  The results have implications for healthy aging among persons coping with  multimorbidity.","2020-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:25","","119-133","","1","32","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 31088579","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Aging; Linear Models; *healthy aging; Canada; Canada/epidemiology; Aging/*psychology; *Health Behavior; *Resilience, Psychological; Chronic Disease; *resilience; Multimorbidity/*trends; Population Surveillance/*methods; Hardiness; Linear Regression; Population Surveillance -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a baseline survey of a community-based cohort of  persons aged 95 or older. METHODS: Participants were aged 95+ years and resided in  Arakawa Ward in Tokyo on 1 January 2016. We mailed a questionnaire to these  individuals to assess their physical, mental, and social status. Subsequently, if  respondents agreed, we conducted in-home interviews and examined their physical and  cognitive function. Also, we mailed non-respondents a simplified version of full  questionnaire. Additionally, we examined the basic registered data of the study  population and the status of their Long-term Care Insurance. Data at baseline and  1-year follow-up were compared. RESULTS: With regard to Long-term Care Insurance,  423 residents aged 95+ years (78.0%) were on long-term care level, 35 (6.5%) were on  support level, and 84 (15.5%) did not require support. At the 1-year follow-up, 275  (50.7%) had the same care level, 107 (19.7%) required a greater level of care, and  131 had died (annual death rate: 24.2%). Compared to the simplified questionnaire  group (n = 128) and the full questionnaire-only group (n = 14), a higher proportion  of respondents who had completed the full questionnaire and had in-home interviews  (n = 26) were men, lived only with a spouse, had higher activities of daily living,  and reported more positive feelings and well-being.

Moreover,  the vast majority of the work comes from Western industrialized contexts but it is  not known to what extent the same pattern holds in non-Western developing countries.  OBJECTIVE: The current research aims to address these two issues by investigating  the longitudinal effects of income inequality on well-being in China. METHOD: We  used the China Family Panel Studies dataset in 2010-2014. Our study includes a  representative sample of 29,331 residents from 20 provinces in China. The  participants completed measures of well-being, including subjective well-being and  psychological distress. We examined whether provincial-level income inequality in  2010 predicted individual-level well-being in 2014. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses  showed that residents in more unequal provinces had lower subjective well-being and  greater psychological distress. The patterns still held, after controlling for  baseline well-being and a number of covariates, including age, gender, education,  income, ethnicity, marital status, and urban/rural residence. The effects of  inequality on well-being differed across socioeconomic groups. CONCLUSION: Findings  suggest that income inequality has long-term adverse consequences on well-being in a  non-Western developing society. Furthermore, its effects are moderated by financial  wealth.","2019-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","120-128","","","232","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings from a nationally representative study of Costa Rican adults.","Community dentistry and oral epidemiology","","1600-0528 0301-5661","10.1111/cdoe.12466","","OBJECTIVES: Although previous studies have shown that oral diseases can impact certain systemic conditions, dental care has been historically separated from  medical healthcare organizations in middle-income countries. There is a lack of  research approaches which test the independent relationship between oral health and  multidimensional measures of general health. This study analyses the influence of  tooth loss on self-rated health (SRH), hypothesizing that, relatively to certain  morbidity conditions, tooth loss is a health condition associated with SRH. This  study analyses the influence of tooth loss on self-rated health (SRH), hypothesizing  that, relative to certain morbidity conditions, tooth loss is a health condition  associated with SRH. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Costa Rican Longevity and  Healthy Aging Study 1945-1955 Retirement Cohort, a national representative  longitudinal survey including residents born between 1945 and 1955. The association  between severe tooth loss and SRH was analysed cross-sectionally using the first  wave of the study conducted in 2010. A multivariable logistic regression, adjusted  for potential confounders, was performed on 2797 participants. A counterfactual  analysis was additionally performed to illustrate the theoretical change on SRH  prevalence-if all the participants were not to have had severe tooth loss. RESULTS:  Severe tooth loss was associated with poor SRH, after adjustment for smoking,  morbidity, biomarkers and performance-based physical measures. The counterfactual  analysis showed that severe tooth loss was the fifth most important morbidity  condition in determining poor SRH. Declaring a poor SRH would have been decreased by  2.0 percentage points if those participants having severe tooth loss had shared the  same risk pattern of those who had not lost the majority of their teeth. CONCLUSION:  Individuals consider their oral health status to a similar extent as other morbidity  conditions when evaluating their general health. A stronger focus on oral health,  and its impact on general health, could lead to better planning of national  resources, thereby improving accessibility to health care and modifying prevailing  conceptions of health care in low- and middle-income countries.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:45:47","","358-365","","4","47","","Community Dent Oral Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known about conditions  under which such benefits are strengthened. In high-quality relationships, partners  affirm individuals' self-views and offer support that can encourage individuals to  engage in behaviors compatible with their subjective age. Thus, we hypothesized the  benefits of a younger subjective age bias would be stronger among adults in  high-quality relationships. Hypotheses were supported in a 10-year longitudinal  study of married adults (ages 34-84; N > 600): Relationship quality moderated the  effect of subjective age bias on memory performance and heart rate variability, such  that individuals in higher-quality relationships showed stronger beneficial effects  of a younger subjective age bias.

Thus, it is important to identify strategies for the prevention of physical function decline. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting and Participants: A total of 12,658 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study were followed from 2008–2012. Measurements: We examined the association between the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI), a measure of diet quality combining 11 dietary components (vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes, red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices, alcohol, whole grains, omega-3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, sodium), and impairment in physical function, as measured by the SF-36. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of impairment in physical function. Results: In the multivariable-adjusted model, each 10-point increase in total AHEI score was associated with a 10% lower odds of impairment in physical function (OR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.86,0.95), and in the categorical analysis, men with AHEI scores in the top quintile had a 26% lower odds (OR=0.74, 95% CI:0.63,0.86) compared with men in the bottom quintile. For individual AHEI components, higher intake of vegetables (p-trend=0.01), nuts and legumes (p-trend<0.01), polyunsaturated fatty acids (p-trend<0.01) and lower intake of red and processed meats (p-trend=0.03) and sugar-sweetened beverages (p-trend=0.01) were significantly associated with lower odds of physical impairment. For specific foods, higher consumption of lettuce, broccoli, blueberries, peanuts, walnuts and other nuts were associated with lower odds of impairment. Conclusions: In this large cohort of older men, better overall diet quality was significantly associated with a lower odds of impairment in physical function. Given the value of physical function to healthy aging and quality of life, this may represent a particularly compelling public health rationale for older men to improve their diet.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:43:13","","459-465","","5","23","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 31021363","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Descriptive Statistics; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Health Behavior -- In Old Age; Human; Scales; *epidemiology; aging; Fruit; Meat; Vegetables; Healthy Aging; *aging; Diet, Healthy/*methods; Quality of Life/*psychology; *physical function; *Diet Quality; *longitudinal cohort study; epidemiology; longitudinal cohort study; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Diet Quality; Diet, Healthy -- methods; physical function; Quality of Life -- psychology; Multiple Logistic Regression; Legumes; Walnut; Eating Behavior -- In Old Age; Physical Mobility; Blueberry; Broccoli; Disability Evaluation -- In Old Age; Fatty Acids, Unsaturated; Fruit Juices; Lettuce; Nuts; Peanut; Sweetened Beverages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings suggest that serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive  protein (hsCRP), z-inflammation composite score [ICS, combining elevated hsCRP and  ESR with low serum albumin and iron], and serum interleukin (IL) 1β were positively  associated with ΔCES-D(total) (Δ: annual rate of increase) among Whites only. IL-12  was directly related to ΔCES-D(total) among men and AA. The race-specific  associations of hsCRP, ICS, IL-1β and the sex-specific association of IL-12 with  ΔCES-D(total) were replicated for the ""depressed affect"" domain. Similarly, among  men, lower serum albumin and higher ICS were linked with higher baseline ""somatic  complaints"". IL-10 among AA and IL-12 among men were inversely related to Δ""positive  affect"", while ""interpersonal problems"" were cross-sectionally associated with IL-6  among AA and IL-10 among Whites.

DNA methylation  (DNAm) has been proposed as a biomarker of biological aging that conserves memory of  endogenous and exogenous stress during life.We examined the association of education  level, as an indicator of SEP, and lifestyle-related variables with four biomarkers  of age-dependent DNAm dysregulation: the total number of stochastic epigenetic  mutations (SEMs) and three epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum and Levine), in 18  cohorts spanning 12 countries.The four biological aging biomarkers were associated  with education and different sets of risk factors independently, and the magnitude  of the effects differed depending on the biomarker and the predictor. On average,  the effect of low education on epigenetic aging was comparable with those of other  lifestyle-related risk factors (obesity, alcohol intake), with the exception of  smoking, which had a significantly stronger effect.Our study shows that low  education is an independent predictor of accelerated biological (epigenetic) aging  and that epigenetic clocks appear to be good candidates for disentangling the  biological pathways underlying social inequalities in healthy aging and longevity.","2019-04-14","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:54:43","","2045-2070","","7","11","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 31009935  PMCID: PMC6503871","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Aging -- psychology; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Aging -- genetics; Social Class; socioeconomic position; biological aging; DNA Methylation; *Life Style; *Epigenesis, Genetic; epigenetic clocks; *biological aging; *education; *epigenetic clocks; *socioeconomic position; Aging/*genetics/*psychology; Mutation; education; Epigenesis, Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Body composition, muscle mass and muscle histology were remarkably stable over 18 years of advanced aging in S. Analysis of genes involved in muscle remodeling showed that S had higher mRNA levels of myogenic differentiation factors (Myogenin, MyoD), embryonic myosin (eMyHC), enzymes involved in regulated breakdown of myofibrillar proteins (Smad2, Trim32, MuRF1,) and NCAM compared with healthy adult men (n = 8). S also had higher mRNA levels of eMyHC, Smad 2, MuRF1 compared with NS. At 88 years, S expressed decreased levels of Myogenin, MyoD, eMyHC, NCAM and Smad2 towards those seen in NS at 70 years. The gene expression pattern of S at 70 years was likely beneficial since they maintained muscle fiber histology and appendicular lean body mass until advanced age. The expression pattern at 88 years may indicate a diminished muscle remodeling coherent with a decline of reinnervation capacity and/or plasticity at advanced age.","2020-03-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:38:44","","654-663","","4","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

The current study examined associations between  systemic inflammation and cognitive performance among African-Americans and Whites  urban adults. METHODS: Participants were selected from the Healthy Aging in  Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study (2004-2013, baseline  age: 30-64 y, mean ± SD follow-up time of 4.64 ± 0.93 y, N = 189-222, k = 1.5-1.7  observations/participant). Cytokines known to be positively linked to AD incidence  among others were tested against cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive  function, stratifying by age group (≤50 y vs. >50 y), sex and race. A series of  mixed-effects regression models were conducted, adjusting for key confounders.  RESULTS: Among key findings, IL1β was positively associated with a faster rate of  decline on a test of executive functioning, among older adults (age >50 y,  γ(11) = +2.49 ± 0.89, p = 0.005), while in the total population, IL-6 was linked to  a faster decline on a test of verbal memory (γ(11) = -0.011 ± 0.004, p = 0.009).  Among younger participants, IL-18 was linked to a poorer performance on a test of  attention at baseline (age ≤50 y, γ(01) = -0.007 ± 0.0025, p = 0.004) though a  slower rate of decline with higher IL-18 was detected for a test of psychomotor  speed in older adults (age >50 y, γ(11) = +0.0010 ± 0.0004, p = 0.008). Finally,  among Whites, unlike among African-Americans, IL-6 was associated with a better  baseline performance on two tests of verbal and working memory. CONCLUSIONS:  Cytokines were shown to be associated with age-related cognitive decline among  middle-aged and older urban adults in an age group and race-specific manner.

We hypothesize that higher PVAT volume at midlife is prospectively associated with slower gait speed later in life, independent of overall adiposity and other risk factors.Methods: Participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cardiovascular fat ancillary study were included. PVAT volume around the descending aorta was quantified using existing computed tomography scans at midlife, while gait speed was measured after an average of 10.4 ± 0.7 years.Results: Two hundred and seventy-six women (aged 51.3 ± 2.8 years at PVAT assessment) were included. Mean gait speed was 0.96 ± 0.21 m/s. Adjusting for study site, race, education level, menopausal status, and length of descending aorta at PVAT assessment, and age, body mass index, difficulty paying for basics, overall health and smoking status at gait speed assessment, a higher midlife PVAT volume was associated with a slower gait speed later in life (p = .03). With further adjustment for presence of any comorbid conditions by the time of gait speed assessment, the association persisted; every 1SD increase in log-PVAT was associated with 3.3% slower gait speed (95% confidence interval: 0.3-6.3%; p = .03).Conclusion: Greater PVAT in midlife women may contribute to poorer physical function in older age supporting a potential role of midlife PVAT in multiple domains of healthy aging. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the physiologic changes associated with PVAT that may underlie the observed associations.","2019-11-13","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:38","","1959-1964","","12","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

However, epidemiological evidences on the influence of these early-life  risk factors on trajectories of healthy ageing are inconsistent, preventing drawing  solid conclusion about their potential influence. Here, to fill this knowledge gap,  we used a statistical approach adapted to estimating change over time and an  outcome-wide epidemiology approach to investigate whether early-life SEC were  associated with the level of and rate of decline of physical, cognitive and  emotional functioning over time. METHODS: We used data on more than 23 000 adults in  older age from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, a 12-year  large-scale longitudinal study with repeated measurements of multiple health  indicators of the same participants over time (2004 -2015, assessments every 2  years). Confounder-adjusted linear growth curve models were used to examine the  associations of early-life SEC with the evolution of muscle strength, lung function,  cognitive function, depressive symptoms and well-being over time. RESULTS: We  consistently found an association between early-life SEC and the mean levels of all  health indicators at age 63.5, with a critical role played by the cultural aspect of  disadvantage. These associations were only partly explained by adult-life SEC  factors. By contrast, evidences supporting an association between early-life SEC and  the rate of change in health indicators were weak and inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS:  Early-life SEC are associated with health in old age, but not with trajectories of  healthy ageing. Conceptual models in life course research should consider the  possibility of a limited influence of early-life SEC on healthy ageing trajectories.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","703-711","","8","73","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","eng","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In addition, social networks are important for healthy aging. This study aimed to  examine the association between HI and social relationships. RESEARCH DESIGN AND  METHODS: This study was conducted by the National Institute for Longevity Sciences  as part of its Longitudinal Study of Aging with 1176 Japanese participants aged 60  years or older (mean age 71.0 ± 7.4). The convoy model was used to evaluate  participants' network size. A pure-tone average hearing level (HL) of 0.5, 1, 2, and  4 kHz in the better ear >25 dB HL was defined as HI. Multivariate analysis was  performed to assess the relationship between HI and the network size, adjusting for  age, gender, years of education, presence of depressive symptoms, and higher-level  functional capacity score. RESULTS: The mean network sizes across the three circles  of the convoy model differed significantly by HI status (18.7 ± 0.4 in the no-HI  group vs 17.0 ± 0.5 in the HI group, p = 0.003). In particular, the number of  non-kin in the outer circle was significantly less in the HI group (4.1 ± 0.2 vs  3.3 ± 0.3, p = 0.004). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The social network size was  significantly smaller in the HI group. The outer circle of people to whom the  individual feels less close and the number of non-kin were related to the presence  of HI. Therefore, HI may be associated with elderly people's social relationships.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:06:07","","75-80","","","83","","Arch Gerontol Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/glz093","","BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a promising strategy for the promotion of brain health, although substantial variation exists in the effects of PA at the  individual level. Given the greater prevalence and faster progression of Alzheimer's  disease in women compared to men, and known sex differences in brain architecture,  analysis of sex differences in the relationship between PA, cognition, and brain  region volumes is warranted. METHODS: To address this, we conducted secondary  analyses of data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. To determine  whether longitudinal changes in PA over 10 years predicted declines in global  cognitive functioning and executive functions and processing speed differently in  males and females, latent growth curve modeling was utilized. Magnetic resonance  imaging was performed at year 10, and the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal  cortex were identified as regions of interest. RESULTS: Maintaining PA over 10 years  predicted less declines in executive functions and processing speed in females but  not males. Maintaining PA over 10 years was significantly associated with greater  volume of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in  executive functions, in year 10 in females only. Maintaining physical activity was  associated with better global cognitive function in both males and females, and also  predicted volume of the left hippocampus, albeit in different directions with  females showing a negative relationship and males showing a positive relationship.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the relationship of PA with cognition and  its neurobiological correlates differ by sex, with females apparently benefiting  from PA to a greater extent than males. Development of personalized, tailored  exercise recommendations to promote healthy brain aging should account for sex  differences.","2020-03-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:58:16","","764-770","","4","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

We determined the  longitudinal association between the respective biomarker indices with progression  to all-cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its amnestic and nonamnestic  subtypes. METHODS: CN participants, recruited by advertising, underwent brain  [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic  resonance imaging, and [F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET, and were designated  as having high or low amyloid-β (A+/A-), greater or lower white matter  hyperintensities burden (V+/V-) and diminished or normal cortical glucose metabolism  (N+/N-). MCI was adjudicated using clinical assessments. We examined the association  between A, V, and N biomarker positivity at study baseline and endpoint, with  progression to MCI using linear regression, Cox proportional hazards and  Kaplan-Meier analyses adjusted for age and APOE-ε4 carrier status. RESULTS: In 98 CN  individuals (average age 74 years, 65% female), A+, V+, and N+ prevalence was 26%,  33%, and 8%, respectively. At study endpoint (median: 5.5 years), an A+, but not a  V+ or N+ scan, was associated with higher odds of all-cause MCI (Chi-square = 3.9, p  = .048, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 2.6 [1.01-6.8]). Baseline A+, V+, or  N+ were not associated with all-cause MCI, however, baseline A+ (p = .018) and A+N+  (p = .049), and endpoint A+N+ (p = .025) were associated with time to progression to  amnestic, not nonamnestic, MCI. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal assessments clarify the  association between amyloid-β and progression to all-cause MCI in CN individuals.  The association between biomarker positivity indices of amyloid-β and  neurodegeneration, and amnestic MCI reflects the underlying pathology involved in  the progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease.","2019-10-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:38:54","","1753-1760","","11","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

All-cause mortality was  collected over a 5-year follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard models were used  to determine the association between each physical fitness test and survival,  adjusted for age, sex, level of ID, and Down syndrome. RESULTS: The physical fitness  components that were independently predictive for survival were manual dexterity  (HR = 0.96 [0.94-0.98]), visual reaction time (HR = 1.57 [1.28-1.94]), balance  (HR = 0.97 [0.95-0.99]), comfortable gait speed (HR = 0.65 [0.54-0.78]), fast gait  speed (HR = 0.81 [0.72-0.91]), grip strength (HR = 0.97 [0.94-0.99]) and  cardiorespiratory fitness (HR = 0.997 [0.995-0.999]), with a better physical fitness  showing a lower mortality risk. CONCLUSION: We showed for the first time that  physical fitness was independently associated with survival in older adults with  intellectual disabilities. Improving and maintaining physical fitness must become an  essential part of care and support for this population.","2019-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","958-966","","4","32","","J Appl Res Intellect Disabil","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors.

We aim to examine the associations of specific  leisure activities with the risk of cognitive impairment among oldest-old people in  China. METHODS: This community-based prospective cohort study included 10,741  cognitively normal Chinese individuals aged 80 years or older (median age 88 years)  from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Cognitive function was  assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cox proportional hazards  models were utilized to estimate the effects of specific leisure activities on  cognitive impairment outcome. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 3.4 years  (41,760 person-years), 2,894 participants developed cognitive impairment. Compared  to those who ""never"" engaged in watching TV or listening to radio, reading books or  newspapers, and playing cards or mah-jong, those who engaged in such activities  ""almost every day"" reduced their risk of cognitive impairment, the fully-adjusted  hazard ratios were 0.56 (0.51-0.61), 0.64 (0.53-0.78), and 0.70 (0.56-0.86),  respectively. The association between the risk of cognitive impairment and watching  TV and listening to the radio, playing cards or mah-jong, and reading books or  newspapers were stronger among those who had two or more years of education.  Moreover, the association between risk of cognitive impairment and watching TV and  listening to radio was stronger in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a  greater frequency of TV watching or radio listening, reading books or newspapers,  and playing cards or mah-jong may decrease the risk of cognitive impairment among  the oldest-old.","2020-03-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:53:45","","739-746","","4","75","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

We descriptively examined the  association between SSA and cognitive function in a population-level sample of  middle- and older-aged adults. METHODS: We analyzed the tracking dataset of the  Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Participants aged between 45 and 85 years  answered questions about SSA and performed three cognitive tests (Rey Auditory  Verbal Learning Test, Animal Fluency Test and Mental Alternation Test) via  telephone. We divided global SSA and global cognitive function scores into tertiles  and generated contingency tables for comparisons across strata defined by sex, age  group, region of residence, urban vs. rural residence and education. RESULTS: The  proportion of participants with low global cognitive function was often greater  among persons who reported low global SSA. The proportion of persons with high  cognitive function was greater in participants with high SSA.

We sought to investigate how food  groups associate brain region-specific volume changes over 4 years in a general  population. Methods: We obtained data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study  on 848 community-dwelling individuals. The participants completed a dietary  examination using a food frequency questionnaire between 2005 and 2006 to determine  habitual usual intakes of food consumption and two brain magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scans between 2011 and 2014 and between 2015 and 2017, respectively. The 106  food items in the questionnaire were regrouped into 18 food groups. A multivariable  generalized linear model was used with the adjustment of potential confounding  variables. Results: The average age at baseline was 53.5 years. The average  follow-up year of brain MRI was 4.13 ± 0.33 years. With considering a corrected p  value due to multiple comparisons, vegetable intake indicated a statistically  significant inverse association with gray matter volume change (β = -2.28,  p = 0.006), after adjusting for potential confounding variables.

Given dietary  intakes, along with BMI, are substantial contributors to disease burden, this study  aimed to investigate prospective changes in dietary patterns and nutrient intakes in  a sample of mid to late-life women over 14 years. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN:  Participants were from the Women's Healthy Ageing Project (WHAP); a longitudinal  cohort of Australian-born women within the Melbourne metropolitan area. 173  participants were included in this analysis, their mean age in 1998 was 55 years  (range 51-62) and in 2012 was 70 years (range 66-76). Diet was assessed using the  Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies Version 2 in 1998 and 2012.  Nutritional intakes, Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) scores, Mediterranean Diet  (MD) scores, sociodemographic and physical measures were calculated for all  participants at both time points. RESULTS: Energy intake was found to significantly  decrease over time (p<0.005). Energy-adjusted (i.e., energy density) total fat,  saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and cholesterol intakes increased over time (all  p<0.002), while energy-adjusted and absolute carbohydrate intake decreased  (p<0.002). Adherence to the MD decreased over time (p<0.001) whilst DII scores  increased slightly over time, although this result was not significant. CONCLUSIONS:  This study shows significant changes in the intake of energy and several nutrients  in a cohort of aging Australian women in the Melbourne metropolitan area over a  period of 14 years. Between 1998 and 2012, changes in indices reflecting overall  diet were consistently in the direction of a poorer diet.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:38:34","","139-149","","1","28","","Asia Pac J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 30896425","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Energy Intake; Female; Aging; Cohort Studies; Feeding Behavior; Prospective Studies; Australia; *Aging; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Diet Surveys; *Feeding Behavior; *Diet Surveys; Geriatric Assessment -- methods; Middle Age; Surveys; Eating Behavior; Geriatric Assessment -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Participants were  1,025 women (mean age = 73.1 ± 9.6 y) enrolled in the Rancho Bernardo Study who  attended a clinic visit between 1988 and 1992, when pregnancy history (ever  pregnant, number of pregnancies, ages at first and last pregnancy) was recorded and  cognitive function was assessed with a battery of four tests repeated up to 7 times  through 2016. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the  association between pregnancy history and longitudinal change in cognitive function.  RESULTS: Overall, 77% of women had at least one pregnancy; number of pregnancies  ranged from 1 to 14 (mean = 2.9 ± 1.7). Ages at first and last pregnancy ranged from  16 to 44 years (mean = 24.9 ± 4.7) and 16 to 49 years (mean = 30.7 ± 5.5),  respectively. Of 16 associations tested (4 pregnancy exposures by 4 cognitive  tests), one was statistically significant without correction for multiple  comparisons. Women who reported ever being pregnant recalled 0.12 fewer words on the  Buschke Selective Reminding Test for every year increase in age than women who had  never been pregnant (P = 0.05). No other significant associations of pregnancy  history with cognitive decline were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show no  clinically meaningful long-term influence of pregnancy history on age-related change  in cognitive function. These reassuring findings suggest childbearing decisions and  timing will not affect cognitive function in older age.","2019-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:14:21","","750-757","","7","26","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30889095","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Pregnancy; Young Adult; Healthy Aging/*physiology; California; Cognitive Aging/*physiology; *Reproductive History; Maternal Age; Parity/physiology; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Cognitive Aging -- physiology; Parity -- physiology; Reproductive History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unknown, however, whether associations among CMV titers,  stress, and immune aging are more stable or dynamic over time. The present  investigation tested the between-person (stable differences) and within-person  (dynamic fluctuations) associations of CMV titers and perceived stress on  late-differentiated T and natural killer (NK) peripheral blood cells in a  longitudinal study of older adults aged 64-92 years (N = 149). Participants reported  stress levels and provided blood biannually for 2.5 years (up to 5 waves per person)  to assess CMV IgG titers and composites of late-differentiated CD8 T cells (CD28-  and CD57 + subsets) and CD56(dim) NK cells (CD57+, NKG2C+, and FcεRIγ- subsets). In  multilevel models that controlled for demographic variables, higher CMV titers were  associated with higher proportions and counts of aged T and NK cells between people  and lower counts of aged T cells within people. Perceived stress was associated with  higher counts of aged T cells between people, but was not associated with aged NK  cells. A significant interaction between stress and CMV titers on T cells between  people indicated that older adults with lower stress levels and lower CMV titers had  the lowest proportions of late-differentiated T cells, whereas those with higher  stress levels had high proportions, regardless of CMV control. Our results provide  evidence for longer-term, between-person associations among CMV titers, stress, and  immunological aging, rather than dynamic within-person associations. We propose that  targeting factors that promote low, stable perceived stress in older adults may  retard T cell differentiation and ultimately support healthy aging.","2019-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","266-274","","","80","","Brain Behav Immun","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were classified based on HIV status (H+ vs H-) and elevated depressive symptoms (D+ vs D-) into four groups (H+/D+; H-/D+; H+/D-; H-/D-).Results: Fifty-eight percent of PLWH had elevated depressive scores, compared to 33% of HIV- individuals (p < 0.001). The proportion of individuals reporting elevated depressive symptoms only differed among individuals 36-45 years old (H+: 61.5%; H-: 17.9%; p < 0.001). Individuals in the H+/D+ group reported the lowest HRQoL, resilience, grit, and SRSA across age cohorts. However, there were no differences on HRQoL or positive psychological factors between H+/D- and H-/D- groups; in fact, individuals 56-65 years in the H+/D- group endorsed aging the most successfully.Limitations: Small sample size within the groups and the cross-sectional nature of the analysis limit the ability to address onset of depressive symptoms in relation to HRQoL or positive psychological factors.Conclusions: Among PLWH depressive symptoms show a strong association with HRQoL and positive psychological factors compared to HIV- individuals.

We examined whether negative age stereotypes, which older individuals tend to  assimilate from the environment across their lifespan, contributed to an increased  risk of developing four psychiatric conditions, and, if so, whether this risk was  reduced through active coping. METHOD: The sample consisted of participants aged 55  years and older, free of the psychiatric conditions at baseline, drawn from the  National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative  sample. New cases of posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, generalized  anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder were assessed during three waves  spanning a four-year period. RESULTS: As predicted, participants holding  more-negative age stereotypes were more likely to develop the psychiatric  conditions, and their engagement in active coping reduced the risk of their  developing these conditions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that prevention and  treatment efforts designed to reduce psychiatric conditions in later life may  benefit from bolstering active coping as well as positive age stereotypes.","2019-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:19:32","","25-29","","","228","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019.

Clustered health trajectories  were identified using a longitudinal variant of k-means and were based on health and  satisfaction with life. Random forests with conditional interference were computed  to examine predictive capabilities. Key predictors included psychological resilience  resources, exposure to childhood adversities, and chronic stress. Data was collected  via a survey, at two different time points one year apart.Results: Two different  clustered health trajectories were identified: A 'constant high health' (low number  of health-related symptoms, 65.6%) and a 'maintaining low health' profile (high  number of symptoms, 34.4%). Over the one-year study period, both symptom profiles  remained stable. Random forest analyses showed chronic stress to be the most  important predictor in the interaction with other risk and also buffering  factors.Conclusion: This study provides empirical evidence for two stable health  trajectories in later life over one year. These results highlight the importance of  chronic stress, but also psychological resilience resources in predicting aging  trajectories.","2020-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1098-1107","","7","24","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30836010","","","","Aged; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Personal Satisfaction; *Successful aging; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; *Machine Learning; *Resilience, Psychological; *conditional interference; *longitudinal k-means; *random forest; *trajectories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using prospective data from the Health and Retirement  Study (n = 5,698), we examined whether higher baseline optimism was associated with  subsequent increased likelihood of maintaining healthy aging over 6-8 years of  follow-up. Optimism was assessed at study baseline (2006 or 2008), and components of  healthy aging were assessed every 2 years, defined as: 1) remaining free of major  chronic diseases; 2) having no cognitive impairment; and 3) good physical  functioning. Hazard ratios were obtained using Cox proportional hazards models, and  a range of relevant covariates were considered (sociodemographic factors, depressive  symptoms, and health behaviors). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and  depression, the most (top quartile) versus least (bottom quartile) optimistic  participants had a 24% increased likelihood of maintaining healthy aging (95% CI:  1.11, 1.38). Further adjustment for health behaviors did not meaningfully change the  findings. Optimism, a potentially modifiable health asset, merits further research  for its potential to improve likelihood of health in aging.","2019-06-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1084-1091","","6","188","","Am J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019.

RESULTS:  Cognitive performance and functional ability significantly worsened with decreasing  kidney function. After adjusting for age, sex, education, comorbidity index of the  Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS), body mass index, bone fracture and serum  ferritin levels the associations of eGFR categories with basic and instrumental  functional abilities continued to be statistically significant whereas that with  global cognitive functions did not. No significant independent association was found  between renal function and mood. CONCLUSIONS: Oldest-old with reduced kidney  function showed greater basic and instrumental functional disabilities, while  cognitive function, although decreased with decreasing eGFR, was no longer  significantly associated with eGFR categories after adjusting for confounders.","2020-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","48-54","","1","25","","Nephrology (Carlton)","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 30821069","","","","Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Quality of Life; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; aging; *Cognition; Biomarkers/blood; Creatinine/blood; *Glomerular Filtration Rate; *Cognitive Aging; *Affect; Anemia/blood/epidemiology; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*psychology; cognitive function; cross-sectional study; EGFR; functional abilities; Healthy Aging/blood/*psychology; Italy/epidemiology; Kidney; Kidney Diseases/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/*physiopathology; kidney function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients typically receive hospital meals upon personal preference within the  framework of the food administration services of the hospital. In the present study,  we assessed food provision and actual food and snack consumption in older patients  admitted for elective hip or knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: A prospective observational  study. SETTING: Orthopedic nursing ward of the Maastricht University Medical  Centre+. PARTICIPANTS: In the present study, n=101 patients (age: 67±10 y; hospital  stay: 6.1±1.8 d) were monitored during hospitalization following elective hip or  knee arthroplasty. MEASUREMENTS: Energy and protein provided by self-selected  hospital meals and snacks, and actual energy and protein (amount, distribution, and  source) consumed by patients was weighed and recorded throughout 1-6 days. RESULTS:  Self-selected meals provided 6.5±1.5 MJ•d-1, with 16, 48, and 34 En% provided as  protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. Self-selected hospital meals provided  0.75±0.16 and 0.79±0.21 g•kg-1•d-1 protein in males and females, respectively.  Actual protein consumption averaged merely 0.59±0.18 and 0.50±0.21 g•kg-1•d-1,  respectively. Protein consumption at breakfast, lunch, and dinner averaged 16±8,  18±9, and 20±6 g per meal, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Though self-selected hospital  meals provide patients with ~0.8 g•kg-1•d-1 protein during short-term  hospitalization, actual protein consumption falls well below 0.6 g•kg-1•d-1 with a  large proportion (~32%) of the provided food being discarded. Alternative strategies  are required to ensure maintenance of habitual protein intake in older patients  admitted for elective orthopedic surgery.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","299-305","","3","23","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30820520  PMCID: PMC6399806","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Feeding Behavior/*physiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; *consumption; *hospital meals; *hospitalization; *Protein; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip/*adverse effects/methods; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee/*adverse effects/methods; Energy Intake/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterise older Australians according to their  wait times for a home care package (HCP), evaluate the association between wait time  and mortality and evaluate the association between wait time and transition to  permanent residential aged care services after HCP. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort  study using data from the National Historical cohort (2003-2014) of the Registry of  Older South Australians (ROSA) was conducted. SETTING: Home based aged care  services, national cohort. METHODS: Wait time was estimated from approval date to  date of receiving a HCP. Descriptive, survival estimates (95% confidence intervals  (CIs)), and multivariable survival analyses (Cox-regression) were conducted to  evaluate the risk of mortality and transition to permanent residential aged care  services by quartiles of wait time for HCP. RESULTS: The cohort was followed for 4.0  years (interquartile range IQR (1.8-7.2)) and 38% were alive at the end of the study  period with a median wait time for HCP of 62 (21-187) days. From 178,924 older  people who received a HCP during the study period (2003-2013), 33.2% people received  HCP within 30 days, 74.3% within 6 months and 25.7% after 6 months. The effect of  wait time on risk of mortality was time-dependent, with longer wait times associated  with higher mortality in the longer term. Compared to people who waited ≤30 days for  a HCP, individuals who waited more than 6 months had an almost 20% excess risk of  death (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 95%CI = (1.18, 1.16-1.21)) 2 years after entry  into a HCP. Those who waited more than 6 months also had a 10% (1.10, 1.06-1.13)  higher risk of transition to permanent residential aged care services after two  years. CONCLUSION: Prolonged wait times for HCP is associated with a higher risk of  long-term mortality as well as transition to permanent residential aged care. It  remains to be seen if a shortening of this wait time translates into better health  outcomes.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","271-280","","3","23","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30820516  PMCID: PMC6399871","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Mortality; *Healthy ageing; Retrospective Studies; *mortality; Registries; *aged care; *nursing home; *wait time; Delivery of Health Care/*methods; Home Care Services/*standards; South Australia; Waiting Lists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because life-courses are typically complex, models are used to simplify their description.  The most commonly used model is tripartite, representing lives in subsequent periods  of education, work, and retirement. However, researchers criticize this model as  limited in the activities considered, overly simplistic in the activity sequence,  and blind to variation between life-courses. This article explores working age  life-courses, which typically show high diversity. Multichannel sequence and cluster  analyses are conducted on people's activities from age 15 to 65. Data stem from the  life-history interviews of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe,  capturing cohorts born before 1945. Findings show that three out of four working age  life-courses are in line with the tripartite model. This share is particularly high  among men, the cohort born 1935 to 1944, and in Northern and Eastern Europe. In  contrast, a considerable share of women spent their working age on homemaking,  especially women born before 1935, and those living in Southern Europe. Finally, a  smaller number of men spent their working age on paid work, followed by a period of  illness or of non-employment. The working age life-course patterns identified are  used to develop alternative life-course models. However, for a parsimonious  solution, the use of two models suffices. A combination of the tripartite model and  the model equating middle age to homemaking captures the lives of more than nine out  of ten older Europeans. The prevalence of working age life-course patterns in a  population is country-specific, and the country differences align with the welfare  regimes. This perspective makes working age life-courses characteristics of a  society that can be used to map social inequalities at the macro-level and capture  social change over time.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:58:18","","1","","2","14","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30794599  PMCID: PMC6386340","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Europe; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Retirement; *Healthy Aging; *Retirement; Healthy Aging; Young Adult; *Life Style; *Socioeconomic Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Health-related lifestyles (HRL) are generally regarded as modifiable  influencing factors of cognitive decline. The present study investigated how HRLs at  two different life stages (one at midlife and the other at later life) affect MCI  occurrence among community-dwelling elders, as part of the Diet and Healthy Aging  (DaHA) study in Singapore. The frequencies of major HRL activities were compared  between 119 clinical diagnosed MCI cases and 632 normal aging controls with  functional cognition. The associations of HRLs with MCI were determined by  multivariate logistic regression analysis and adjusted according to known factors  including age, childhood education, and major chronic diseases (hypertension,  stroke, diabetes, and cataracts or glaucoma). Long-hour working in midlife (adjusted  OR = 0.418 with 95% CI 0.215-0.812) and social engagement in later-life (adjusted  OR = 0.532 with 95% CI 0.329-0.859) were associated with reduced risks of MCI,  respectively. It is important to note that those elders who had both midlife  long-hour working and later-life social engagement were related to the lowest risk  of MCI (adjusted OR = 0.285 with 95% CI 0.143-0.565), when compared to the least  active subgroup who neither had worked long hours in midlife nor participate in  social activities in later-life. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that  midlife long-hour working and later-life social engagement were modifiable factors  for the maintenance of cognitive functions.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:34:02","","1067-1077","","3","67","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 30776006","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Logistic Models; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Singapore; Singapore/epidemiology; *mild cognitive impairment; Independent Living/psychology/statistics & numerical data; Social Participation/*psychology; Healthy Aging/psychology; *Health-related lifestyle; *later-life; *midlife; *social engagement; *work; Cognitive Dysfunction/*epidemiology/etiology; Employment/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Employment; Community Living; Logistic Regression; Community Living -- Psychosocial Factors; Social Participation -- Psychosocial Factors; Employment -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Population-based prospective cohort study. and participants: In Spain, 3228 community-dwelling individuals aged 60 years or older were followed up for 10 years. At baseline and 3 follow-up visits, a DA index (0 to 100% deficit) was calculated based on the number and severity of 52 health deficits across the domains of physical and cognitive function, self-rated health and vitality, mental health, and morbidity. Trajectories of overall and domain-specific DA indexes were estimated using mixed models for repeated measurements, allowing for homogeneous linear, piecewise linear, and smooth nonlinear DA trends over age. Women showed greater DA than men, but differences leveled out with age: annual increments in DA index (95% confidence interval) for participants aged <70, 70-80, and ≥80 years were, respectively, 0.40 (0.30-0.50), 0.68 (0.57-0.80), and 1.30 (1.07-1.54) in men and 0.63 (0.53-0.73), 0.99 (0.89-1.10), and 1.31 (1.09-1.53) in women. These changes were mainly driven by a progressive accumulation of chronic diseases and by quadratic declines in physical and cognitive function. Both men and women showed improvements in mental health with age. In general, women and participants with lower education had decreased physical and cognitive function and accumulated morbidities faster than their counterparts. Only individuals with very fast declines in function and fast accumulation of morbidities showed a significant worsening of self-rated health and vitality over time. Public health interventions aimed at promoting healthy ageing should focus on prevention and early control of chronic diseases, as well on the preservation of function and early rehabilitation, with the latter being more relevant during the latter stages of life. Post-acute and long-term care services should incorporate adequate physical therapy and nursing facilities to promote attainable levels of functionality in older adults.","2019-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:25:39","","710-717.e6","","6","20","","J Am Med Dir Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

METHODS: Early or previous conditions refer to the situations before  15 years of age of the interviewees, such as economic condition, famine, health  assessment, medical conditions, and having lived in the countryside for over 5  years. The control variables were gender, education, andincome. The outcome was  self-reported health as ""good"" or ""bad."" This study focused on ages between 60 and  65years. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis showed significant associations of the  individual's origin in all the three cohorts. Economic and famine conditions were  also significant for cohort B (2006). Multivariate Poisson regression was used with  prevalence ratio as an element of comparison. Rural origin was the only significant  early condition in the initial model. Thecontrol variables - gender, cohort, and  education - were also significant. In the final model, the significant variables in  the initial model were included, plus relation between rural origin and the number  of diseases. Cohorts, gender, education, and the number of diseases were still  significant factors when individuals had rural origin, but were not associated with  the outcome if their origin was urban.

We also found significant epistatic  KIBRA-APOE interactions on brain FNC in the left superior frontal gyrus and left  angular gyrus in default-mode network. No significant KIBRA-APOE interactions were  detected in other brain resting-state networks.

Differential educational  environments in adolescence may affect individual cognitive function. This study  examines the impact of high school educational quality on late-life cognition among  community-dwelling older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: Data were collected from  community-dwelling individuals from the Philadelphia Healthy Brain Aging (PHBA)  cohort at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The present analysis  included subjects from the PHBA over the age of 55 years without a diagnosis of  Parkinson's disease or dementia, who had attended high school in the City of  Philadelphia. Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA);  clinical information was abstracted from the subject's electronic health record.  High school information was obtained from the Philadelphia Board of Education. After  univariable correlations were defined, we performed stepwise multiple linear  regression models to determine the most significant predictors of late-life  cognitive status. RESULTS: A total of 130 subjects meeting inclusion criteria were  included in the analysis. Years of education, race, educational level, school  district, and financial status were all positively associated with MoCA. Significant  negative associations included composite vascular risk, attendance at highly  segregated schools, and historical poverty status. In stepwise multiple linear  regression modeling, the impact of race on cognition remained significant when  educational attainment was added to the model but was no longer significant once  segregation status was added. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that academic and  community factors beyond years of education have a marked impact on late-life  cognition.","2019-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","855-862","","6","34","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30714212","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Retrospective Studies; Linear Models; *healthy aging; Cognition/*physiology; *dementia; *cognition; *Educational Status; *mild cognitive impairment; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; *quality of education; Cognition Disorders/etiology/*psychology; Philadelphia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dual-task walking, such as walking while performing  a cognitive task, is a necessary skill for everyday functioning, and has been shown  to activate prefrontal lobe areas in healthy older people. Another well-established  point in healthy aging is the loss of grey matter, and in particular loss of frontal  lobe grey matter volume. However, the relationship between increased frontal lobe  activity during dual-task walking and loss of frontal grey matter in healthy aging  remains unknown. In the current study, we combined oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2))  data from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), taken during dual-task  walking, with structural MRI volumetrics in a cohort of healthy older subjects to  identify this relationship. We studied fifty-five relatively healthy, older  participants (≥65 years) during two separate sessions: fNIRS to measure HbO(2)  changes between single-task (i.e., normal walking) and dual-task  walking-while-talking, and high-resolution, structural MRI to measure frontal lobe  grey matter volumes. Linear mixed effects modeling was utilized to determine the  moderation effect of grey matter volume on the change in prefrontal oxygenated  hemoglobin between the two walking tasks, while controlling for covariates including  task performance. We found a highly significant interaction effect between frontal  grey matter volume and task on HbO(2) levels (p < 0.0001). Specifically, increased  HbO(2) levels during dual-task compared to single-task walking were associated with  reduced frontal grey matter volume. Regional analysis identified bilateral superior  and rostral middle gyri as the primary areas driving these results. The findings  provide support for the concept of neural inefficiency: in the absence of behavioral  gains, grey matter loss in relatively healthy, older individuals leads to  over-activation of frontal lobe during a cognitively demanding walking task with  established clinical and predictive utility.","2019-04-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:28:33","","745-754","","","189","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However,  the origins of variation in these measures are not well understood. METHODS: In a  pooled sample of 104 Swedish and Danish twin pairs, we estimated, at the mean age of  70 (baseline) and 79 years (follow-up), the genetic and environmental influences on  the Horvath and Levine clocks. FINDINGS: A model incorporating additive genetic (A)  and person-specific environmental (E) influences best explained the variation in  both clocks. Heritability was estimated at 55% at baseline and at 51% at follow-up  for the Horvath clock and 34% at baseline and 41% at follow-up for the Levine clock.  For the Horvath clock, new sources of A influences emerged at follow-up, whereas for  the Levine clock, the same A influences accounted for the genetic variance at both  measurement occasions. The cross-time phenotypic correlations, 0·52 for the Horvath  clock and 0·36 for the Levine clock, were mediated primarily by genetic factors,  whereas the person-specific environmental factors were completely different at the  two measurement occasions. INTERPRETATION: For both clocks, new sources of  person-specific environmental influences emerge with age. The epigenetic clocks  might thus be responsive to new environmental stimuli even at old age.

We hypothesized that optimism and hostility may affect CHD risk via changes in heart rate variability (HRV).Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the Women's Health Initiative Myocardial Ischemia and Migraine Study. Participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring 3 years after enrollment. Optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), cynical hostility (Cook-Medley), demographics, and coronary risk factors were assessed at baseline. HRV measures included standard deviation of average N-N intervals (SDNN); standard deviation of average N-N intervals for 5 minutes (SDANN); and average heart rate (HR). CHD was defined as the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, angina, coronary angioplasty, and bypass grafting. Linear and Cox regression models adjusted for CHD risk factors were used to examine, respectively, associations between optimism, hostility, and HRV and between HRV and CHD risk.Results: Final analyses included 2655 women. Although optimism was not associated with HRV, hostility was inversely associated with HRV 3 years later (SDANN: adjusted β = -0.54; 95% CI = -0.97 to -0.11; SDNN: -0.49; 95% CI = -0.93 to -0.05). HRV was inversely associated with CHD risk; for each 10-millisecond increase in SDNN or SDANN, there was a decrease in CHD risk of 9% (p = .023) and 12% (p = .006), respectively.Conclusions: HRV did not play a major role in explaining why more optimistic women seem to be somewhat protected from CHD risk. Although hostility was inversely associated with HRV, its role in explaining the association between hostility and CHD risk remains to be established.","2019-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:12:26","","256-264","","3","81","","Psychosom Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30688770  PMCID: PMC6443472","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Emotions; Prospective Studies; Scales; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Personality; *Aging/physiology/psychology; *Coronary Disease/epidemiology/physiopathology/psychology; *Hostility; *Optimism/psychology; *Personality/physiology; Middle Age; Coronary Disease -- Epidemiology; Coronary Disease -- Physiopathology; Coronary Disease -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To map spaceflight-induced intracranial  extracellular free water (FW) shifts and to evaluate changes in brain white matter  diffusion measures in astronauts. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed  retrospective, longitudinal analyses on dMRI data collected between 2010 and 2015.  Of the 26 astronauts' dMRI scans released by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health, 15 had both preflight and  postflight dMRI scans and were included in the final analyses. Data were analyzed  between 2015 and 2018. INTERVENTIONS OR EXPOSURES: Seven astronauts completed a  space shuttle mission (≤30 days) and 8 completed a long-duration International Space  Station mission (≤200 days). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The dMRI scans were  acquired for clinical monitoring; in this retrospective analysis, we analyzed brain  FW and white matter diffusion metrics corrected for FW. We also obtained scores from  computerized dynamic posturography tests of balance to assess brain-behavior  associations. RESULTS: Of the 15 astronauts included, the median (SD) age was 47.2  (1.5) years; 12 were men, and 3 were women. We found a significant, widespread  increase in FW volume in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes from before  spaceflight to after spaceflight. There was also a significant decrease in FW in the  posterior aspect of the vertex. All FW changes were significant and ranged from  approximately 2.5% to 4.0% across brain regions. We observed white matter changes in  the right superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, the corticospinal tract, and  cerebellar peduncles. All white matter changes were significant and ranged from  approximately 0.75% to 1.25%. Spaceflight mission duration was associated with  cerebellar white matter change, and white matter changes in the superior  longitudinal fasciculus were associated with the balance changes seen in the  astronauts from before spaceflight to after spaceflight. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  Free water redistribution with spaceflight likely reflects headward fluid shifts  occurring in microgravity as well as an upward shift of the brain within the skull.  White matter changes were of a greater magnitude than those typically seen during  the same period with healthy aging. Future, prospective assessments are required to  better understand the recovery time and behavioral consequences of these brain  changes.","2019-04-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","412-419","","4","76","","JAMA Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30673793  PMCID: PMC6459132","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Time Factors; United States; Case-Control Studies; Retrospective Studies; Postural Balance/physiology; *Space Flight; *Weightlessness; Astronauts; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism/physiopathology; Cerebellum/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Extracellular Fluid/*metabolism; Fluid Shifts/*physiology; Pyramidal Tracts/diagnostic imaging/metabolism; United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration; White Matter/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated whether midlife biomarkers of heart and kidney damage capturing the cumulative impact of long-term adverse exposures were associated with the level and decline in physical capability over 9 years of follow-up, taking account of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.Methods: We used data on 1736 men and women from the oldest British birth cohort study with walking speed, chair rise speed, balance time, and grip strength assessed at ages 60 to 64 and 69 years. We tested associations between logged and standardized measures of cystatin C, NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), interleukin (IL)-6, and E-selectin at age 60 to 64 years with performance at age 69 years, adjusting for sex, height, and body mass index; then for performance at age 60 to 64 years. These biomarkers were mutually adjusted, and additionally adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors (pulse pressure, total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin), diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and kidney disease, smoking status, and lifetime socioeconomic position.Results: Cystatin C, NT-proBNP, and IL-6 (but not E-selectin) were inversely associated with all outcomes, adjusted for sex, height, and body mass index. For example, a 1-SD increase in logged NT-proBNP was associated with weaker grip (-0.63 kg, 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.28); the equivalent association for cystatin C was -0.60 kg (95% CI, -0.94 to -0.25) and for IL-6 was -0.76 kg (95% CI, -1.11 to -0.41). Most associations remained, albeit attenuated, after adjustment for previous performance and mutual adjustment of the biomarkers. NT-proBNP and IL-6 (but not cystatin C) were more strongly associated with the outcomes than many of the conventional risk factors after mutual adjustment.Conclusions: Higher levels of NT-proBNP may identify those in midlife at risk of accelerated physical decline. Before considering the use of NT-proBNP for risk stratification, further research should untangle whether these associations exist because the biomarker is an integrated measure of cumulative exposures to relevant stressors across life, or whether it is marking additional risk pathways. Randomized trials to reduce the rate of decline in physical capability or delay incident disability could benefit from including middle-aged adults and adding NT-proBNP and IL-6 as intermediate outcomes.","2019-04-23","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:47:15","","1988-1999","","17","139","","Circulation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30667283  PMCID: PMC6485301","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Male; Body Mass Index; Follow-Up Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Blood Pressure; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Smoking/epidemiology; *aging; Physical Fitness/*physiology; Body Height; *cohort studies; United Kingdom/epidemiology; *inflammation; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood; Biomarkers/*blood; *cystatin C; *natriuretic peptides; Cholesterol/blood; Cystatin C/*blood; E-Selectin/blood; Glycated Hemoglobin A/analysis; Heart Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/physiopathology; Inflammation/*blood/epidemiology/physiopathology; Interleukin-6/*blood; Kidney Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/physiopathology; Lipoproteins, HDL/blood; Middle Aged/*physiology; Peptide Fragments/*blood; Inflammation -- Epidemiology; Middle Age; Impact of Events Scale; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain -- Blood; Cholesterol -- Blood; Inflammation -- Blood; Physical Fitness -- Physiology; Interleukins -- Blood; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Lipoproteins, HDL -- Blood; Antigens, Surface -- Blood; Heart Diseases -- Blood; Heart Diseases -- Epidemiology; Heart Diseases -- Physiopathology; Inflammation -- Physiopathology; Kidney Diseases -- Blood; Kidney Diseases -- Epidemiology; Kidney Diseases -- Physiopathology; Peptides -- Blood; Proteins -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that  decline in openness would be associated with death. Using longitudinal data from the  Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), the analytic sample encompassed 1954  individuals, approximately two-thirds of whom were deceased. We tested whether  openness declines across late adulthood and, central to our hypothesis, whether the  decline correlated with age at death. Multivariate modeling adjusted for age at  study entry, sex, education, as well as the time-varying effects of physical  illness, depressive symptoms, and cognitive ability. Correlations between change in  neuroticism and extraversion and death were modeled for comparison. A follow-up  cotwin control analysis adjusted for genetic and environmental familial confounders.  Significant mean-level change was identified in all personality traits, but only for  openness was change correlated with age at death, in support of our hypothesis. The  findings were not explained by health factors or cognition. Cotwin control analyses  indicated that the twin who died earlier showed a greater drop in openness prior to  death, compared with their cotwin measured at the same time points. There was no  cotwin finding for neuroticism or extraversion. We suggest that declines in openness  may reflect a change in goal orientation due to the experience of a shortened time  horizon, leading to an optimized selection of experiences as people approach the end  of life.

This variability, in combination with methodical  differences and differences in sample characteristics across studies, pose a major  challenge for generalizability of results from different studies. Therefore, the  current study aimed at cross-validating age-related differences in cognitive  abilities and brain structure (measured using cortical thickness [CT]) in two large  independent samples, each consisting of 228 healthy older adults aged between 65 and  85 years: the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database (University of  Zurich, Switzerland) and the 1000BRAINS (Research Centre Jülich, Germany).  Participants from LHAB showed significantly higher education, physical well-being,  and cognitive abilities (processing speed, concept shifting, reasoning, semantic  verbal fluency, and vocabulary). In contrast, CT values were larger for participants  of 1000BRAINS. Though, both samples showed highly similar age-related differences in  both, cognitive abilities and CT. These effects were in accordance with functional  aging theories, for example, posterior to anterior shift in aging as was shown for  the default mode network. Thus, the current two-study approach provides evidence  that independently on heterogeneous metrics of brain structure or cognition across  studies, age-related effects on cognitive ability and brain structure can be  generalized over different samples, assuming the same methodology is used.","2019-06-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2305-2319","","8","40","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2019 The Authors.

We examine the association between personality traits  (the 'Big Five') and a variety of preventive healthcare utilisation measures in the  older population. Using data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), we  estimate Poisson models of preventive healthcare utilisation (influenza vaccination,  blood cholesterol test, breast lump check, mammogram, prostate examination,  prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test). We find that openness to experience is a  significant predictor of breast lump check and mammogram in women aged 65+ after  adjustment for other confounders and multiple hypothesis testing. While uptake of  many preventive healthcare services remains below national recommendations for the  older population, with the exception of breast lump checks and mammograms for women  aged 65+, we find little evidence to link this heterogeneity in uptake to  personality.","2019-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:22:15","","107-112","","","120","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated investigate the association  between BMD and mortality, and to examine whether the rate of bone loss can predict  future mortality in an elderly population. This study was conducted as a part of the  Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging, a community-based prospective study  of Korean people aged 65 years and older that began in 2005. A total of 648 people  (318 men and 330 women) were included. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were  conducted at baseline and at 5 years. Mortality data were collected until the date  of death or the last follow-up in December 2014. Osteoporosis in all skeletal sites  significantly related to increased risk of mortality in men and women, but the  associations were stronger for BMD in the femur neck and total hip than in the  lumbar spine. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model showed that baseline  BMD level was a significant independent predictor of increased all-cause mortality  for all three skeletal sites in men, and for lumbar spine and total hip in women.  Furthermore, faster bone loss of BMDs, as shown by the decline in BMD in the lumbar  spine, femur neck, and total hip, was significantly related to increased risk of  mortality after adjusting for all covariates in men. Faster BMD loss at femur neck  was also related to the increased risks of mortality in women. Conclusively, both a  lower baseline values and greater decline in BMD were associated with excess  morality in community-dwelling elderly population; there associations were stronger  in men than in women. This study emphasizes the importance of skeletal health for  healthy aging, revealing lower bone mass and faster bone loss may be markers of  poorer health that are driving excess mortality.","2019-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","204-211","","","121","","Bone","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVES: To  evaluate associations between demographic and psychosocial variables and loneliness,  examine any age-specific associations, and compare centenarians (aged ≥100 years)  with elderly people (aged 65-99 years). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this  retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study, previously collected data from  all New Zealanders 65 years and older who completed their first international  Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (interRAI-HC) assessment during the study  period (January 1, 2013, to November 27, 2017) were reviewed. Participants were  people living independently in the community who were requesting or referred for  assessment with a potential need for support services. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  The interRAI-HC is a 236-item, electronically recorded assessment that encompasses a  comprehensive range of aspects of an older person's life, including physical,  psychological, and cognitive domains. Eight main items from the interRAI-HC data set  were analyzed to describe the population and evaluate the core psychosocial  components of aging, namely, age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, living  arrangements, family support, depression, and loneliness. Loneliness was evaluated  by the participants' response to the assessment statement, ""Says or indicates that  he/she feels lonely."" RESULTS: A total of 73 286 New Zealanders (mean age, 81.4  years; age range, 65-109 years; 41 641 [56.9%] female) participated in the study.  The assessments of 191 centenarians (mean [SD] age, 100.9 [1.2] years) and 73 095  elderly people (mean [SD] age, 81.4 [7.6] years) were analyzed. Centenarians vs  elderly people were more likely to be female (136 [71.2%] vs 41 488 [56.8%];  P < .001), and the populations differed by marital status (widowed: 170 [89.0%] vs  31 554 [43.2%]; overall P < .001) and depression status (70.2% vs 59.5% free of  depression; overall P = .008). Centenarians were less likely to be lonely compared  with elderly people, with a 22% lower risk of loneliness for a typical centenarian  (aged 100.9 years) compared with a typical elderly person (aged 81.4 years) in  unadjusted analyses (relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.92; P = .002). In the fully  adjusted model, there was a 32% reduction in loneliness for a centenarian compared  with an elderly person (relative risk, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58-0.79; P < .001). Living  with others, having family support, and lacking depression were associated with  lower risk of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Centenarians are a unique group  to study as a model of successful aging. The sample of centenarians in this study  appeared to be less lonely than other groups studied internationally. The study  identified multiple psychosocial variables that were associated with the risk of  loneliness, including living arrangements, family support, and depression. Knowing  these variables may help our society address risk factors for loneliness in older  people.","2018-10-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e183880","","6","1","","JAMA Netw Open","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30646265  PMCID: PMC6324443","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Retrospective Studies; Quality of Life/*psychology; Aged/psychology; Marital Status; Aged, 80 and over/*psychology; Depression/psychology; Loneliness/*psychology; New Zealand/epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To develop  commodity-based relative deprivation indicators and evaluate their associations with  mortality, we conducted a 6-year follow-up of participants in the Japan  Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES), a population-based cohort of Japanese  adults aged 65 and older. We analyzed mortality for 7614 respondents from 2010 to  2016. Cox regression models with multiple imputation were used to estimate hazard  ratios (HRs) for mortality. Seven indicators were significantly associated with  mortality: no refrigerator, no air conditioner, cut-off of essential services in the  past year for economic reasons, and so on. Among participants, 12.0% met one item,  and 3.3% met two items or more. The HRs after adjusting for relative poverty and  some confounders were 1.71 (95%CI: 1.18⁻2.48) for relative deprivation, and 1.87  (95%CI: 1.14⁻3.09) for a combination of relative poverty and deprivation.

METHOD: A prospective sample of n = 62 stroke patients (case  group) and n = 53 healthy ageing individuals (control group) were eligible to  participate in the study. A neuropsychological battery of cognitive assessments were  conducted on all participants, and then stratified by cognitive function: no  cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment and moderate to severe cognitive  impairment. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Most frequent ApoE genotype was e2/e3 in case  (44%) and control groups (63%). ApoE allele e3 had the highest frequency for both  groups with all stroke patients presenting with this allele and 86% for the control  group (χ(2)  = 12.14, p < .0001). Stroke patients' non-carriers for ApoE allele e4  performed better on all cognitive measures but differences were not statistically  significant (ns). Carriers of ApoE allele e2 in both groups had less mood symptoms  compared to non-carriers. DISCUSSION: ApoE genotype e3/e4 and e4/e4 was low in this  Bahraini cohort explaining why there may been no significant associations found for  this genotype variant with cognitive impairment. Further investigation of cognitive  impairment and mood dysregulation with the different variants of the ApoE gene in  general ageing and stroke populations is required from different ethno-cultural  groups and geographical regions globally.","2019-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:54:08","","135-142","","","39","","Asian J Psychiatr","","","","","","","","English","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We show that  independently of age, sex, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status, higher  worthwhile ratings are associated with stronger personal relationships  (marriage/partnership, contact with friends), broader social engagement (involvement  in civic society, cultural activity, volunteering), less loneliness, greater  prosperity (wealth, income), better mental and physical health (self-rated health,  depressive symptoms, chronic disease), less chronic pain, less disability, greater  upper body strength, faster walking, less obesity and central adiposity, more  favorable biomarker profiles (C-reactive protein, plasma fibrinogen, white blood  cell count, vitamin D, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), healthier lifestyles  (physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality, not smoking),  more time spent in social activities and exercising, and less time spent alone or  watching television. Longitudinally over a 4-y period, worthwhile ratings predict  positive changes in social, economic, health, and behavioral outcomes independently  of baseline levels. Sensitivity analyses indicate that these associations are not  driven by factors such as prosperity or depressive symptoms, or by outcome levels  before the measurement of worthwhile ratings.

This paper aimed to assess whether the associations  between life-course SECs (early-life, young adult-life, middle-age and old-age) and  risk of poor self-rated health (SRH) trajectories in old age are modified by welfare  regimes (Scandinavian [SC], Bismarckian [BM], Southern European [SE], Eastern  European [EE]). METHODS: We used data from the longitudinal SHARE survey. Early-life  SECs consisted of four indicators of living conditions at age 10. Young adult-life,  middle-age, and old-age SECs indicators were education, main occupation and  satisfaction with household income, respectively. The association of life-course  SECs with poor SRH trajectories was analysed by confounder-adjusted multilevel  logistic regression models stratified by welfare regime. We included 24 011  participants (3626 in SC, 10 256 in BM, 6891 in SE, 3238 in EE) aged 50 to 96 years  from 13 European countries. RESULTS: The risk of poor SRH increased gradually with  early-life SECs from most advantaged to most disadvantaged. The addition of  adult-life SECs differentially attenuated the association of early-life SECs and SRH  at older age across regimes: education attenuated the association only in SC and SE  regimes and occupation only in SC and BM regimes; satisfaction with household income  attenuated the association across regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Early-life SECs have a  long-lasting effect on SRH in all welfare regimes. Adult-life SECs attenuated this  influence differently across welfare regimes.","2019-08-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1352-1366","","4","48","","Int J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2019; all rights reserved.

METHOD:  Participants (aged 60-93 years; N = 415) were recruited through the Healthy Ageing  Research Program (HARP), University of Western Australia, and completed Form A of  the RBANS as part of a wider neuropsychological test battery. Regression-based  techniques were used to generate normative data rather than means-based methods.  This methodology allows for the control of demographic variables using continuous  data. To develop norms, the data were assessed for: (1) normality; (2) associations  between each subtest score and age, education, and gender; (3) the effect of age,  education, and gender on subtest scores; and (4) residual scores which were  converted to percentile distributions. RESULTS: Differences were noted between the  three samples, some of which were small and may not represent a clinically  meaningful difference. Younger age, more years of education, and female gender were  associated with better scores on most subtests. Frequency distributions, means, and  standard deviations were produced using unstandardized residual scores to remove the  effects of age, education, and gender.

METHODS: The sample comprised 8317 older  adults (46.02% men) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Robust structural  equation modelling was used to identify symptom trajectories and their relationships  with time-varying factors. Trajectory class and covariates were used to predict  outcomes (quality of life, satisfaction with life, and daily living functioning) in  a 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: Three trajectory classes (so-called, normative,  subclinical, chronic symptom trajectories) were identified for both sexes. Rising  hearing difficulties and history of psychiatric problems were consistently  associated with the chronic symptom trajectory. Lower education level, history of  psychiatric problems, and increasing visual difficulties were connected with the  subclinical trajectories. Finally, participants with either a subclinical or a  chronic symptom trajectory showed worse outcomes than the remaining participants in  the follow-up.

Growing research finds that higher optimism is associated with lower mortality, yet it is critical to understand whether this prolonged longevity is accompanied by good health. This study tested whether higher optimism was associated with increased likelihood of healthy aging.Methods: Prospective data analyzed in 2018 from the Nurses' Health Study included 33,326 women with no major chronic diseases at baseline. Poisson regression models evaluated if optimism was associated with healthy aging 8 years later, considering potential confounders (sociodemographic variables, depression) and intermediate variables (health behaviors). Optimism was assessed in 2004 by validated self-report using mailed questionnaires and healthy aging was assessed in 2012, defined as (1) remaining free of major chronic diseases; (2) having no subjective memory impairment; (3) having intact physical function; and (4) surviving through follow-up.Results: Overall, 20.5% of women (n=6,823) fulfilled the definition of healthy aging in 2012. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and depression, the most (top quartile) versus least (bottom quartile) optimistic women had a 23% greater likelihood of healthy aging (95% CI=1.16, 1.30). Associations were similar in white and black participants, although the sample of black women was small (n=354).Conclusions: Higher optimism was associated with increased likelihood of healthy aging, suggesting that optimism, a potentially modifiable health asset, merits further research for its potential to improve health in aging.","2019-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:23:47","","116-124","","1","56","","Am J Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study sought to describe how older  participants in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) who are living with  obesity are aging, through an examination of measures of social, functional and  mental well-being. METHODS: We used data from the first wave of the CLSA for people  aged 55 to 85 years in this study. We used descriptive statistics to describe  characteristics of this population and adjusted generalized logistic models to  assess measures of social, functional and mental well-being among obese participants  (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) relative to non-obese participants. Findings are  presented separately for females and males. RESULTS: More than half of the  participants reported living with a low personal income (less than $50 000); females  were particularly affected. Less than half of the participants were obese; those who  were had higher odds of multimorbidity than those who were not living with obesity  (among those aged 55-64 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0-3.5 males; OR 2.8,  95% CI: 2.2-2.5 females). Low social participation was associated with obesity among  older female participants, but not males. Physical functioning issues and  impairments in activities of daily living were strongly associated with obesity for  both females and males. While happiness and life satisfaction were not associated  with obesity status, older females living with obesity reported negative impressions  of whether their aging was healthy. CONCLUSION: The odds of multimorbidity were  higher among participants who were obese, relative to those who were not. Obese  female participants tended to have a negative perception of whether they were aging  healthily and had lower odds of involvement in social activities, while both sexes  reported impairments in functional health. The associations we observed, independent  of multimorbidity in older age, highlight areas where healthy aging initiatives may  be merited.","2018-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","437-444","","12","38","","Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can","","","","","","","","fre","","","","","","","PMID: 30540410  PMCID: PMC6329578","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Personal Satisfaction; healthy aging; Aging/physiology/*psychology; Canada/epidemiology; Comorbidity; Income; Social Participation; Anxiety/epidemiology; happiness; Happiness; mental health; Mood Disorders/epidemiology; multimorbidity; obesity; Obesity/*epidemiology/physiopathology/*psychology; Smoking/*epidemiology; social participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A set of 45 self-reported health items and measured tests were used to generate a latent health metric reflecting levels of functioning referred to as health metric (higher values indicated better health status). Overall mortality after 10-years of follow-up (2002-2012) was recorded.Results: Both education and household wealth over time were positively associated with the health metric (p < 0.001) and negatively with overall mortality (p < 0.001). Lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity, smoking habits and alcohol consumption) mediated the effect of education and household wealth on the health metric and the latter mediated their effect on overall mortality.Conclusions: In conclusion, reducing socioeconomic disparities in health by improving the access to education and by providing financial opportunities should be among the priorities in improving the health of older adults.","2018-12-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:57:06","","1357","","1","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30526556  PMCID: PMC6288914","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Health; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Scales; *Health Status Disparities; *Social Determinants of Health; Health Status Disparities; Healthy aging; Social Determinants of Health; England/epidemiology; Mortality/*trends; Education; Financial status; Social determinants; Socioeconomic; England; Middle Age; Mortality -- Trends; Social Readjustment Rating Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether there were any differences in the effects of  intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) in DMN connectivity between younger and  older adults, its associations with cognition and brain integrity, as well as with  long-term cognitive status. Twenty-four younger and 27 cognitively normal older  adults were randomly assigned to receive real or sham iTBS over the left inferior  parietal lobule between two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging  (rs-fMRI) acquisitions. Three years later, those older adults who had received real  iTBS underwent a cognitive follow-up assessment. Among the younger adults,  functional connectivity increased following iTBS in distal DMN areas from the  stimulation site. In contrast, older adults exhibited increases in connectivity  following iTBS in proximal DMN regions. Moreover, older adults with functional  responses to iTBS resembling those of the younger participants exhibited greater  brain integrity and higher cognitive performance at baseline and at the 3-year  follow-up, along with less cognitive decline. Finally, we observed that 'young-like'  functional responses to iTBS were also related to the educational background  attained amongst older adults. The present study reveals that functional responses  of the DMN to iTBS are modulated by age. Furthermore, combining iTBS and rs-fMRI in  older adults may allow characterizing distinctive cognitive profiles in aging and  its progression, probably reflecting network plasticity systems that may entail a  neurobiological substrate of cognitive reserve.","2019-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","794-806","","","188","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This  is the first study to explore associations between gain in sense of coherence and  future positive aging. Methods: Our longitudinal sample consisted of 125 physically  active individuals (73.5% women) at the mean age of 71 years at follow-up (range: 64  to 87 years; response rate: 73.5%), who completed our questionnaire twice. There  were no systematic differences between the follow-up responders and non-responders.  Results: The sense of coherence increased over four years, disclosing a small effect  size. The baseline sense of coherence had a substantial predictive value for future  subjective well-being and psychological health, but not for physical health.  Stepwise hierarchical regression analyses showed that both the baseline sense of  coherence and gain in sense of coherence predicted future subjective well-being and  psychological health. With respect to future physical health, only gain in sense of  coherence was significant. Conclusion: Consistent with gero-salutogenic theory, the  baseline sense of coherence is an effective predictor of future positive aging, and  growth in sense of coherence within a time span of four years is reflected in  improved positive aging. It is important to encourage experiences in older age that  cultivate the three components of the sense of coherence-feelings of  comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness.","2019-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:17:58","","1562-1568","","11","23","","Aging & Mental Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30444131","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; *Healthy Aging; Healthy Aging; Optimism; *subjective well-being; *positive aging: longitudinal study; *Sense of coherence; Emotional Adjustment; Sense of Coherence; Psychological Well-Being; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Psychological Theory; Functional Status; Effect Size; Positive Psychology -- Evaluation; Regression -- Methods; Self Concept -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between sexual health, thyroid hormones,  cognitive functions, and physical fitness in elderly population. METHODS: Fifty-one  fit adults were recruited (age: 71.9 ± 5.3 years, 26 females and 25 males).  Sexuality was evaluated using the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire-short  form (CSFQ-14) and the Sexual Attitude Scale (SAS). Thyroid function was assessed by  measuring serum TSH, FT3, and FT4. Cognitive functions and depressive symptoms were  evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test and Geriatric Depression  Scale (GDS) scores. Subjects' physical fitness was evaluated using the following  tests: Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Handgrip test (HG), Timed Up and  Go test (TUG), and 2-Minute step test (ST). RESULTS: CSFQ-14 positively correlated  with MMSE (p < 0.05) and negatively with GDS (p < 0.05), while thyroid function was  not correlated with sexuality, in both genders. A negative relationship between FT4  vs. weight, FT3 vs. HG and FT3/FT4 ratio vs. ST were found (p = 0.05) in females,  while in males, it occurred for TSH vs. TUG (p < 0.05); a positive relationship  existed in females between FT4 vs. ST (p < 0.05). Finally, CSFQ-14 was significantly  correlated with SPPB (p < 0.05), CST, TUG, and ST (p < 0.01), in both genders.  CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a strict relationship between active sexuality,  preserved cognitive function and appropriate physical fitness in elderly subjects,  independently from gender. Our preliminary data suggest that in elderly fit  population, peripheral thyroxin deiodination may be a useful predictor of better  physical performance and more successful aging.","2019-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","699-707","","6","42","","J Endocrinol Invest","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 30406377","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Sex Factors; Postural Balance; Prognosis; Cognition/*physiology; *Activities of Daily Living; Successful aging; *Physical Fitness; *Sexuality; Mild cognitive impairment; Physical fitness; Sexual behavior; Sexual Behavior/*physiology; Thyroid hormones; Thyroid Hormones/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING:  Newcastle-upon-Tyne and North Tyneside, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS:  Community-dwelling older adults aged 85 at baseline (N=722). METHODS: Protein intake  was estimated using two 24-hour multiple-pass recalls at baseline. Disability was  measured as difficulty performing 17 activities of daily living at baseline and 18,  36, and 60 months. Trajectories were derived using mortality-adjusted group-based  trajectory modelling. The effect of protein intake (g/kg of adjusted body weight  (aBW)/d) on disability trajectories was examined using multinomial logistic  regression. RESULTS: Participants had 4 distinct disability trajectories (between  the ages of 85 and 90: constant very low (AT1), mild (AT2), moderate (AT3), and  severe (AT4). Each unit increase in protein (g) per kg of aBW/d was associated with  greater odds of AT1 (odds ratio (OR=7.97, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.96-32.43, p  = .004) and AT2 (OR=3.28, 95% CI=1.09-9.87, p = .03) than of AT4 over 5 years in  models adjusted for selected covariates.

As people live longer, it is important to maximise the opportunity to age healthily. We aimed to examine the associations of lifestyle behaviours with healthy ageing in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Peru, Mexico and Puerto Rico, part of the 10/66 study. Residents 65 years old and over (n = 10,900) were interviewed between 2003 and 2010. In the baseline survey, we measured four healthy behaviours: Physical activity, non-smoking, moderate drinking and fruits or vegetables consumption. Healthy ageing was conceptualised within the functional ability framework over a median of 4 years follow-up. Logistic models were calculated per country and then pooled together with fixed-effects meta-analysis.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/gly253","","Background: A strong association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D levels (25(OH)D) with all-cause mortality has been shown previously and 25(OH)D could be a useful aging marker.Methods: The analysis was performed in a population-based, cohort study from Germany with 9,940 participants, aged 50-74 years at baseline. A general linear model was used to assess associations of 25(OH)D levels with chronological age and the aging markers leukocyte telomere length (LTL), epigenetic age acceleration, and 8-isoprostane levels. A multivariate Cox regression model was applied to explore the independent and combined associations of these biomarkers with all-cause mortality (2,204 deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 14.3 years).Results: On average, study participants lost 2.9 nmol/L 25(OH)D each 10 years of age. Increasing 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with decreasing levels of 8-isoprostane levels but neither with LTL nor epigenetic age acceleration. The association of 25(OH)D quartiles with mortality was almost unchanged after adjusting for all aging markers (1.6-fold increased mortality in bottom quartile compared with top quartile). All aging markers were independent mortality predictors and subjects with unfavorable values for 4, 3, 2, and 1 aging marker(s) had 4.3-, 2.9-, 2.2, and 1.4-fold increased mortality, respectively.Conclusions: The 25(OH)D level can be regarded as an aging marker because it is linearly associated with age and an independent mortality predictor. Mechanisms linking vitamin D to healthy aging are unique and can neither be fully explained by aging of the epigenome, loss of telomeres, or antioxidative effects of vitamin D metabolites.","2019-01-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:58:45","","121-128","","1","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30371905","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Germany; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Retrospective Studies; Biomarkers/blood; Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood; Aging/*blood; Cause of Death/trends; Dinoprost/*analogs & derivatives/blood; Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics; Epigenomics/*methods; Germany/epidemiology; Telomere/*metabolism; Vitamin D Deficiency/*blood/genetics/mortality; Genes; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Vitamin D -- Blood; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Blood; Retrospective Design; Cause of Death -- Trends; Epigenomics -- Methods; Prostaglandins -- Analogs and Derivatives; Prostaglandins -- Blood; Telomere -- Metabolism; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among them, inflamm-aging is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation driving aging-related diseases. The aged immune system is characterized by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines contributing to inflamm-aging. Another possible mechanism resulting in inflamm-aging could be the increased release of danger- associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by increased cell death in the elderly, leading to a chronic low-grade inflammatory response. Several pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system are involved in recognition of DAMPs. The DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway plays a pivotal role in combating viral and bacterial infections and recognizes DNA released by cell death during the process of aging, which in turn may result in increased inflamm-aging.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a variation within the STING gene with known impaired function may be associated with protection from aging-related diseases by decreasing the process of inflamm-aging.Methods: STING (Tmem173) R293Q was genotyped in a cohort of 3,397 aged subjects (65-103 years). The distribution of the variant allele in healthy subjects and subjects suffering from aging-associated diseases was compared by logistic regression analysis.Results: We show here that STING 293Q allele carriers were protected from aging-associated diseases (OR = 0.823, p = 0.038). This effect was much stronger in the subgroup of subjects suffering from chronic lung diseases (OR = 0.730, p = 0.009).Conclusion: Our results indicate that decreased sensitivity of the innate immune receptors is associated with healthy aging, most likely due to a decreased process of inflamm-aging.","2019","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:53:08","","145-154","","2","65","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 S.

However, the longitudinal association between the availability of healthy food stores and mortality is unknown. This study examined the association between neighborhood availability of food stores and mortality by driving status among older adults. Methods: This study drew upon a three-year follow up of participants in the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, a population-based cohort study of Japanese adults aged 65 years or older. Mortality from 2010 to 2013 was analyzed for 49,511 respondents. Neighborhood availability of food stores was defined as the number of food stores selling fruits and vegetables within a 500-m or 1-km radius of a person's residence. Both subjective (participant-reported) and objective (geographic information system-based) measurements were used to assess this variable. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for mortality. Results: A total of 2049 deaths occurred during the follow up. Lower subjective availability of food stores was significantly associated with increased mortality. Compared with participants reporting the highest availability, the age- and sex-adjusted HR for those reporting the lowest availability was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.04–1.58; p = 0.02). The association remained significant after adjustment for sociodemographic (education, income, cohabitation, marital status, and employment status) and environmental (driving status, use of public transportation, and study site) status (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01–1.53, p = 0.04). This association was stronger among non-car users, among whom the HR for those reporting the lowest availability of food stores was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.08–2.41, p = 0.02). In contrast, no significant association was seen between objective availability and mortality. Conclusions: Lower availability of healthy food stores measured subjectively, but not objectively, was associated with mortality, especially among non-car users. Considering the decline in mobility with age, living in a neighborhood with many options for procuring fruits and vegetables within walking distance may be important for healthy aging.","2018-10-19","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:27:04","","101","","1","15","","Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30340494  PMCID: PMC6194719","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Death; Aged, 80 and over; Japan; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Fruit; *Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models; Vegetables; *Older adults; Older adults; *Residence Characteristics; *Japan; Residence Characteristics; *Death; Marital Status; *Food environment; *Food store availability; Automobile Driving/statistics & numerical data; Commerce/*statistics & numerical data; Food Supply/methods/*statistics & numerical data; Geriatric Assessment/methods/*statistics & numerical data; Geriatric Assessment -- methods; Geriatric Assessment -- statistics & numerical data; Automobile Driving -- statistics & numerical data; Commerce -- statistics & numerical data; Food environment; Food store availability; Food Supply -- methods; Food Supply -- statistics & numerical data; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Employment Status; Restaurants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Four communities in the  United States (Cardiovascular Health Study) from 1992 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS: 2622  adults with a mean (SD) age of 74.4 (4.8) and with successful healthy ageing at  baseline in 1992-93. EXPOSURE: Cumulative levels of plasma phospholipid n3-PUFAs  were measured using gas chromatography in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, expressed  as percentage of total fatty acids, including α-linolenic acid from plants and  eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid from  seafoood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Healthy ageing defined as survival without chronic  diseases (ie, cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung disease, and severe chronic  kidney disease), the absence of cognitive and physical dysfunction, or death from  other causes not part of the healthy ageing outcome after age 65. Events were  centrally adjudicated or determined from medical records and diagnostic tests.  RESULTS: Higher levels of long chain n3-PUFAs were associated with an 18% lower risk  (95% confidence interval 7% to 28%) of unhealthy ageing per interquintile range  after multivariable adjustments with time-varying exposure and covariates.  Individually, higher eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid (but not  docosahexaenoic acid) levels were associated with a lower risk: 15% (6% to 23%) and  16% (6% to 25%), respectively. α-linolenic acid from plants was not noticeably  associated with unhealthy ageing (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to  1.02). CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, a higher cumulative level of serially measured  circulating n3-PUFAs from seafood (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and  docosahexaenoic acid), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid (but not  docosahexaenoic acid from seafood or α-linolenic acid from plants) was associated  with a higher likelihood of healthy ageing. These findings support guidelines for  increased dietary consumption of n3-PUFAs in older adults.","2018-10-17","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:00:00","","k4067","","","363","","BMJ","","","","","","","","eng","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We aimed to describe declining incident dementia rates across successive birth cohorts in a U.S. population-based sample and to explore the influences of sex and education on these trends.Methods: We pooled data from two community-sampled prospective cohort studies with similar study aims and contiguous sampling regions: the Monongahela Valley Independent Elders Survey (1987-2001) and the Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (2006-Ongoing). We identified four decade-long birth cohorts spanning birth years 1902-1941. In an analysis sample of 3,010 participants (61% women, mean baseline age = 75.7 years, mean follow-up = 7.1 years), we identified 257 cases of incident dementia indicated by a Clinical Dementia Rating of 1.0 or higher.

We examined the longitudinal association between the  monetary value of the diet (MVD) and the overall dietary quality across sex, race  and income groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Longitudinal data from 1,466 adult urban  participants from Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span  (HANDLS) study were used. Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) and Mean Adequacy  Ratio (MAR) were computed and a national food price database was used to estimate  MVD. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted linking annual rates of  change (Δ) in MVD to ΔHEI-2010 and ΔMAR, stratifying by sex, race and income groups.  Among key findings, ΔHEI-2010 was comparable across socio-demographic groups, while  ΔMAR was higher among women and individuals above poverty. Adjusting for key  covariates, ΔMVD was positively associated with both ΔHEI-2010 and ΔMAR, and with a  consistently stronger association among individuals above poverty, specifically for  the total proteins and empty calories components of HEI-2010 and several nutrient  adequacy ratios (NARs: vitamins C, E, B-6 and Zinc). ΔMVD-ΔMAR association was  stronger in women, mainly influenced by ΔMVD's positive associations with  B-vitamins, copper, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus NARs. ΔMVD-Δvitamin D NAR's  positive relationship was stronger among Whites, while ΔMVD-Δvitamin B-12 NAR's  association was stronger among African-Americans.

We estimated socioeconomic differences in health expectancies in four  studies in England, Finland, France and Sweden. METHODS: We estimated socioeconomic  differences in health expectancies using data drawn from repeated waves of the four  cohorts for two indicators: (i) self-rated health and (ii) chronic diseases  (cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory and diabetes). Socioeconomic position was  measured by occupational position. Multistate life table models were used to  estimate healthy and chronic disease-free life expectancy from ages 50 to 75.  RESULTS: In all cohorts, we found inequalities in healthy life expectancy according  to socioeconomic position. In England, both women and men in the higher positions  could expect 82-83% of their life between ages 50 and 75 to be in good health  compared to 68% for those in lower positions. The figures were 75% compared to  47-50% for Finland; 85-87% compared to 77-79% for France and 80-83% compared to  72-75% for Sweden. Those in higher occupational positions could expect more years in  good health (2.1-6.8 years) and without chronic diseases (0.5-2.3 years) from ages  50 to 75. CONCLUSION: There are inequalities in healthy life expectancy between ages  50 and 75 according to occupational position.

Productive aging is defined as engagement in working, caring, and socially  productive activities (volunteering, informal helping, etc.). Two theoretical  frameworks are examined: (1) the pathway model that emphasizes later life health and  socioeconomic conditions are related to dis(advantages) starting from childhood, and  (2) the latency model that illustrates childhood experiences directly affect  productive engagement due to biomedical influences or values and preferences formed  during childhood. The 2011, 2013 and 2014 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal  Studies (CHARLS) were used as these data sets provide both contemporaneous and  retrospective information. The analytic sample consists of 5818 respondents aged 55  and above. We conduct multilevel analyses and path models to estimate the effects of  childhood conditions, including family background (hukou - household registration -  status and parents' education), neighborhood cohesion, subjective health and  nutrition. Individual and family contemporaneous characteristics and clustered data  structure were controlled for. The results largely support a pathway model in that  childhood health and nutrition affect the likelihood of productive activities in  later life through their influence on cognition and disabilities in old age.  Moreover, family background and neighborhood cohesion are associated with productive  activities via the effects through mid-life work, later life cognition, and  disabilities. Results also provide some support for the latency model through the  direct effect of neighborhood cohesion on socially productive activities,  highlighting the importance of values formed in early life in shaping the  motivations of productive engagement in later life. To conclude, we demonstrate that  better childhood health, an advantaged family background, and values of helping  others instilled in childhood affect older adults' productive engagement. Policies  should be put in place to reduce socioeconomic disadvantages in childhood and also  to cultivate cohesive community environments.","2019-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","60-69","","","229","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Responses were analyzed using structural  equation modeling and path analysis. RESULTS: The study involved 258 participants,  mean age 66.9±7.9 years. Psychological distress and positive perception of aging  exhibited the strongest direct impact on QoL (p<0.0001). Psychological distress also  appeared to be mediator on QoL for perceived health status, self-esteem and negative  perception of aging. Coping centred on emotion exhibited direct impact on  self-esteem and so, indirect impact on QoL (p = 0.0002). Perception of personal  financial situation (p = 0.0007) and coping centred on social support (p = 0.02)  appeared as direct mediators influencing QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological dimensions  are predictors of QOL and have to be taken into account to maximize the resources  with a view to successful aging. Further interventions targeting successful aging  should focus on positive perception aging.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:20:39","","e0204044","","10","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30281672  PMCID: PMC6169874","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; France; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Emotions; Perception; Financing, Personal; Aging/*psychology; Quality of Life/*psychology; Self Concept; *Perception; Quality of Life -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Longitudinal data from four waves of  the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA), collected between 1996 and 2007, were  used for analysis (N = 3,429). Parallel-process latent growth curve modeling was  adopted to evaluate the process by which LTA mediated between sociodemographic  factors (age, gender, education, self-rated health, comorbidities, and depression)  and the outcome process of functional disabilities. RESULTS: When mediated by  baseline level of LTA, five sociodemographic factors-age, gender, education level,  self-rated health, and number of comorbidities-had significant and negative  mediating effects on baseline or change in functional disability, thus improving  disability outcomes. However, four of the sociodemographic factors (age, education  level, and number of comorbidities), when mediated through the rate of change in  LTA, were found to have significant and positive mediating effects, which increased  disability levels. The proportion of effects mediated by the LTA trajectory ranged  from 0% to 194%. DISCUSSION: The large proportion of effects mediated through the  LTA process underlines the importance of LTA to public health policy and health  programs for older adults. The study's findings shed light on how to better target  populations of older adults to promote an active lifestyle and achieve more  successful aging in late life in Asian countries.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0203757","","10","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30281590  PMCID: PMC6169861","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Taiwan; Aging/physiology/*psychology; Leisure Activities/*psychology; *Disease Progression; Asia; Depression/physiopathology/psychology; Disabled Persons/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By means of a confirmatory factor analysis approach, we tested whether a  two-factor solution [corresponding to measures of memory performance (MEM) and  executive functioning (EXEC)] was reliable over time. Nested models of longitudinal  invariance demonstrated the existence of partial strong invariance over time. In  other words, this indicates that there is an equivalence of the factorial structure  and factor loadings for all items; this was also observed for the item intercepts  for all the items, except for one of the items from the EXEC dimension. Stability  coefficients revealed high associations between the dimensions over time and that,  whereas there was a significant decline of the MEM across time, this was not  observed for the EXEC dimension.

The onset of pain may set off a  downward spiral where lowered social participation increases the risk of depression  and vice versa. This study thus assesses whether online social participation (i.e.,  the use of online social network sites) moderates the effect of pain on depression,  possibly functioning as a compensatory mechanism for reduced offline social  participation for those in pain. METHOD: Logistic regression models with a lagged  dependent variable were used with panel data from the National Health and Aging  Trends Study. An interaction term was included to assess the moderating effect of  online social participation. RESULTS: We find that online social participation  buffers the detrimental effect of pain on depression. However, the effect of pain on  online social participation was not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Findings  show that online social participation can alleviate the negative effects of pain on  mental well-being, and suggest that online social participation can supplement  attempts to maintain offline social participation in later life, especially for  those whose social activity may be limited by pain.","2019-08-21","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1020-1031","","6","74","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2018.

In these community-dwelling normal aging women, we found that higher midlife Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile (FCRP) score was associated with greater WMH volume two decades later, and was predominantly driven by the impact of HDL cholesterol level, controlling for age, education and APOE ε4 status. Structural equation modelling demonstrated that the relationship between midlife FCRP score and late life executive function was mediated by WMH volume.

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of  deprivation and urban/rural areas on capability to live well with dementia and to  examine whether availability of informal carers modified the associations. METHODS:  The analysis was based on a large cohort study of 1547 community-dwelling people  with dementia across Great Britain. Quality of life, life satisfaction, and  well-being were measured as indices of ""living well."" Multivariate modelling was  used to investigate differences in living well measures across deprivation quintiles  and urban/rural areas adjusting for sociodemographic factors and number of  comorbidities and stratifying by three groups: those living with a carer, those with  a noncoresident carer and those without a carer. RESULTS: Negative dose-response  relationships between deprivation and measures of quality of life (-2.12; 95% CI:  -3.52, -0.73), life satisfaction (-1.27; 95% CI: -2.70, 0.16), and well-being  (-5.24; 95% CI: -10.11, -0.36) were found in participants living with a carer. The  associations were less clear in those with a noncoresident carer and those without a  carer but these two groups generally reported lower scores on living well indicators  than participants living with a carer. There was no urban/rural difference.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest inequalities in living well with dementia  according to levels of deprivation.

AIM: To explore the relationship between successful  aging and the (retrospectively assessed) change in sexual interest and enjoyment in  the past 10 years, using a new multidimensional model of successful aging. METHODS:  The data for this study was collected in 2016 using national probability-based  surveys in four European countries (Norway, Denmark, Belgium and Portugal). In  total, information from 2,461 sexually active and inactive participants aged 60-75  years was used for analyses. Multigroup structural equation analysis was employed to  address the associations between key constructs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The dependent  variable was a composite (two-item) indicator of change in sexual interest and  enjoyment in the past 10 years; a multifaceted model of successful aging predicted  the change by country and gender. RESULTS: Tested cross-culturally, the proposed  model of successful aging demonstrated a good fit to the data. Furthermore, its  metric characteristics enabled direct comparisons across gender and national  cultures. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, higher successful aging  scores were consistently related to lower reduction in sexual interest/enjoyment  among men and women across the 4 countries. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Given an  increased life-expectancy and focus on healthy aging in many countries, the findings  about the associations between sexual expression, quality of life and aging well are  valuable to professionals working in the area of healthy sexual aging. STRENGTH &  LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to systematically address the relationship  between successful aging and sexuality. Furthermore, it provides a multidimensional  measure of successful aging for a wide range of sexologic studies. Among  limitations, possible self-selection bias (toward more sexually permissive and  sexually active participants) and the fact that the findings are restricted to older  heterosexual individuals, should be considered. CONCLUSION: Without stigmatizing the  absence of sexual expression in aging individuals, the findings from this  cross-cultural study point out that sustained sexual interest and sexual enjoyment  are linked to successful aging in both genders.

The study includes validated self-report measures and individual items that  capture the experiences of stressful events (stressor exposures) and subjective  assessments of stress (perceived stress) within specific life domains. METHODS: This  article reviews and catalogs the peer-reviewed publications that have used the HRS  to examine associations between psychosocial stress measures and psychological,  physical health, and economic outcomes.

We highlight how to  take further advantage of the longitudinal study to test complex biopsychosocial  models of healthy aging. DISCUSSION: The HRS provides one of the most comprehensive  assessments of psychosocial stress in existing population-based studies and offers  the potential for a deeper understanding of how psychosocial factors are related to  healthy aging trajectories. The next generation of research examining stress and  trajectories of aging in the HRS should test complex longitudinal and mediational  relationships, include contextual factors in analyses, and include more  collaboration between psychologists and population health researchers.","2020-04-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","970-980","","5","75","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2018.

A total of 2223  dementia-free Swedish adults aged ≥60 with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  scores ≥27 were followed for an average of 6 years. MMSE was tested during  follow-ups. Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. The NPDP index was  calculated and tertiled (low, moderate, and high adherence). Participation in  physical, mental and social activities was trichotomised (low, moderate, and  intense). An active lifestyle was defined based on the participation in each  activity. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Moderate-to-high adherence  to NPDP was associated with a reduced decline in the MMSE score (β: 0.19, 95%  Confidence Interval (CI): 0.14⁻0.24).

METHOD: Eight thousand three hundred forty-four French community-dwelling adults  aged 65 and above participated in the Three-City prospective population-based study.  Baseline relationships between self-reported mild and severe HL with  depression-assessed by both the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and by  the Centre for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale-were explored using logistic  regression analyses. Logistic mixed models assessed whether baseline HL was  associated with incident depression diagnosis or symptom onset over 12 years in  those who were depression-free at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, mild and severe HL  were associated with depression symptoms as assessed by the CESD (OR = 1.29, 95% CIs  1.14-1.47; OR = 1.51, 95% CIs 1.22-1.87; respectively), although only mild HL was  significantly related to major depression diagnosis (OR = 1.51, 95% CIs 1.07-2.12).

To do so, the association between factors from a number of life domains and QoL was investigated.Methods: Data were from the first three waves of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a prospective nationally representative study of community dwelling older adults in the Republic of Ireland. QoL was measured using the shorter form CASP-12 and the latent growth curve method was used to describe within- and between-person variation in longitudinal QoL trajectories.Results: There was considerable variation in QoL scores cross-sectionally and longitudinally. QoL did not decline linearly with age but increased from age 50 and peaked at 68 years before declining in older age. QoL differed significantly between individuals and decreased over time. A variety of demographic, health, and social characteristics were associated with changes in QoL over time. These included cohabiting; self-rated health; functional limitations; fear of falling; mental health; loneliness; social networks; social activities; caring for grandchildren; income; and death of a spouse.Conclusions: Changes in QoL over time were not merely a function of ageing, or declining health but resulted from factors from a variety of domains with loneliness and social participation particularly important. Policies concerned with successful ageing and QoL among older adults must consider social circumstances as well as physical and psychological well-being.","2019-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:29:21","","429-439","","2","28","","Qual Life Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 30209723","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Ireland; Aged, 80 and Over; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Older age; Aging/*psychology; Quality of life; Quality of Life/*psychology; CASP-12; Latent growth curve model; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to analyze heart failure  epidemiology and treatment trajectories in centenarians compared to nonagenarians  (90-99 years of age) and octogenarians (80-89 years of age) with heart failure and  with heart failure and kidney disease combined. METHODS: This cohort study used  quarterly structured routine data from 1398 German insurants over 6 years prior to  death (398 centenarians were compared with 500 nonagenarians and 500 octogenarians).  Of those, 525 individuals were diagnosed with heart failure before death; 164 had  heart failure and kidney disease combined. Generalized estimation equations were  used to assess the association of diagnoses of heart failure and other diseases with  medication prescriptions. RESULTS: Across age groups, heart failure was  significantly more prevalent in centenarians compared with octogenarians and  nonagenarians. Prevalence of heart failure increased over time. Female sex [odds  ratio (men) = 0.70, p = 0.024], kidney disease (odds ratio = 1.31, p < 0.001), and  hypertension (odds ratio = 1.52, p < 0.001) were all associated with heart failure.  Overall, heart failure treatment changed significantly over time with an increased  prescription rate of loop diuretics and a decreased rate of renin-angiotensin-system  inhibitors. Centenarians were significantly less likely to receive treatment with  renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, loop diuretics, or beta-blockers compared with  nonagenarians and octogenarians. Furthermore, aldosterone inhibitors were seldom  prescribed; If-channel and neprilysin inhibitors were not routinely used in our  sample. For those with heart failure and kidney disease combined, our data revealed  that the prevalence of kidney disease was lower in centenarians than in younger  patients before death. However, differences in prescription rates across age groups  were non-significant, although numerically large. Finally, half of the patients in  all three age groups with heart failure and kidney disease received treatment with  renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors; about two out of five patients received  beta-blockers, while prescription rates of aldosterone inhibitors were low.  CONCLUSIONS: While heart failure prevalence shows a continuous increase with age,  prescription rates are lower in centenarians, emphasizing the need for further  studies considering the quality of care and outcomes in this patient population.  Disease management programs and trials are needed to develop guidelines that address  the medically challenging treatment for very old patients with comorbid heart  failure and kidney disease.","2018-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:36:33","","907-916","","10","35","","Drugs Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: New Zealand PMID: 30187290","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Kidney Diseases -- drug therapy; Age Factors; Odds Ratio; Hypertension -- drug therapy; Comorbidity; Drug Prescriptions/*statistics & numerical data; Heart Failure/*drug therapy; Hypertension/drug therapy; Kidney Diseases/*drug therapy; Drug Prescriptions -- statistics & numerical data; Heart Failure -- drug therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stratified sampling method was used to recruit participants based on their baseline risk profile (low-risk and not low-risk). Low-risk status was defined as untreated SBP/DBP ≤ 120/≤80 mm Hg, untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dl, not smoking, BMI <25 kg/m2, and no diabetes. ECG abnormalities were defined by Minnesota code criteria. Multinomial logistic regression was used.Results: There were 28% women, 9% blacks, and 20% with baseline low-risk status. At follow-up, 21% developed ≥1 major ECG abnormalities, and 58% developed ≥1 minor ECG abnormalities. With multivariable adjustment, compared to those with 2 + high-risk factors, odds for developing from normal to any major ECG abnormalities were lower by 57%, 49%, and 35%, respectively, in persons with low-risk, any moderate-risk, and 1 high-risk factor (P-trend = 0.002). Findings were similar for some common specific subtypes of major and minor abnormalities. Associations were mainly due to baseline smoking and BMI. Remaining free of high-risk factors, or improving risk profile over time was also associated with lower major ECG abnormality development by 70% vs. always having any high-risk factor.Conclusions: Favorable CVD risk profile earlier in life and maintenance or improvement in risk profile over time are associated with lower risk of ECG abnormality development at older age.","2018-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:40:22","","863-869","","5","51","","J Electrocardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We used retrospective Medicare claims  from 2009 to 2014 for a 5% national sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries in the  United States. Propensity score-adjusted logistic regressions were performed to  estimate the log odds of the probability of receiving the preventive services  between beneficiaries who received AWVs during 2011-13 and those who did not during  the same period. The average marginal effect was also reported. Among 845,318  patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23% had an AWV in 2011-2013.  In a propensity-matched sample of 381,934 patients, AWV participants are more likely  to undergo subsequent preventive services within a year (adjusted odds ratio ranges  from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.44, 1.49) to 2.43 (95% CI, 2.38, 2.49). The findings are  consistent using secondary outcomes or with subgroups defined by baseline primary  care provider visits or baseline preventive services. These analyses showed that AWV  is associated with a significant increase in all the preventive services examined.  As Healthy People 2020 has established a target goal to increase the proportion of  older adults who receive a core set of clinical preventive services by 10%, AWV  represents a promising opportunity to facilitate the delivery of preventive care for  the elderly and to advance our knowledge about effective strategies for healthy  aging.","2018-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","126-133","","","116","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Within this context, evidence for an inverse effect of  happiness on mortality is inconclusive. Furthermore, few studies link happiness with  mortality among older people, and in Asian populations. We examine the association  between happiness and all-cause mortality among older people in Singapore. METHODS:  data for 4,478 Singaporeans aged ≥60 years enrolled in a nationally-representative  longitudinal survey (three waves: 2009; 2011; 2015) were utilised. Happiness, at  baseline, in 2009, was measured using three positively-worded items from the Centre  for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and considered in two distinct ways in  the analyses-continuous ('happiness score' [0-6]) and binary (happy [score =  6]/unhappy). All-cause mortality, until 31 December 2015, was assessed primarily  using administrative databases, supplemented by data from survey waves 2 and 3.  Multivariable Cox regression models assessed the association of 'happiness score'  and the 'binary happiness variable' (separate models for each) with all-cause  mortality. RESULTS: the likelihood of all-cause mortality was lower by 9%  (multivariable hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval]: 0.91 [0.87-0.95]) for  each unit increase in 'happiness score', and was 19% lower for happy, versus  unhappy, older people (HR: 0.81 [0.68-0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: happiness is associated  with reduced likelihood of all-cause mortality among older people in an Asian  population, with the benefit observed even for incremental increases in happiness.  Activities, policies and programs that maintain or improve happiness may be  beneficial for a longer life among older people.","2018-11-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","860-866","","6","47","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 30165421","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Age Factors; Protective Factors; Cause of Death; *Longevity; Singapore; Healthy Aging/*psychology; *Happiness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the association between CRF and very-long-term prognosis is  unclear, and reverse causation may bias results in studies with shorter follow-up.  OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the association between CRF and mortality in  middle-aged, employed men free of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS:  Participants from the Copenhagen Male Study, established in 1970 to 1971, were  included and stratified into 4 age-adjusted maximal oxygen consumption (Vo(2)max)  categories: below the lower limit of normal (lowest 5%); low normal (45%); high  normal (45%); and above the upper limit of normal (top 5%). Vo(2)max was estimated  by using a bicycle ergometer. Multivariable restricted mean survival time models  were performed for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality using Danish national  registers. RESULTS: A total of 5,107 men with a mean age of 48.8 ± 5.4 years were  included in the study. During the 46 years of follow-up, 4,700 (92%) men died; 2,149  (42.1%) of the men died of CVD. Compared with below the lower limit of normal CRF,  low normal CRF was associated with 2.1 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7 to  3.4; p = 0.002), high normal with 2.9 years (95% CI: 1.5 to 4.2; p < 0.001), and  above upper limit of normal with 4.9 years (95% CI: 3.1 to 6.7; p < 0.001) longer  mean life expectancy. Each unit increase in Vo(2)max was associated with a 45-day  (95% CI: 30 to 61; p < 0.001) increase in longevity. Estimates for cardiovascular  mortality were similar to all-cause mortality. Results were essentially unchanged  when excluding individuals who died within the first 10 years of follow-up,  suggesting a minimal role of reverse causation.

Women reported maternal and  paternal ages at death and current age of alive parents. Parental survival  categories were <70, 70-79 (reference), 80-89 and ≥90 years (longevity). Healthy  ageing was defined as reaching age 90 without major chronic conditions (coronary  heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or hip fracture) or physical limitations.  RESULTS: women whose mothers survived to ≥90 years were more likely to attain  healthy ageing (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.42) and less likely to die before age 90  (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.83).

One reason for inconsistency in  reported findings may be a lack of consideration of underlying mechanisms that could  influence this relationship. Cognitive reserve is a theoretical concept that may  account for the role of social isolation and its association with cognitive outcomes  in later life. Therefore, we aimed to examine the relationship between social  isolation and cognition in later life, and to consider the role of cognitive reserve  in this relationship. Baseline and two year follow-up data from the Cognitive  Function and Ageing Study-Wales (CFAS-Wales) were analysed. Social isolation was  assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6), cognitive function was  assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), and cognitive reserve  was assessed using a proxy measure of education, occupational complexity, and  cognitive activity. Linear regression modelling was used to assess the relationship  between social isolation and cognition. To assess the role of cognitive reserve in  this relationship, moderation analysis was used to test for interaction effects.  After controlling for age, gender, education, and physically limiting health  conditions, social isolation was associated with cognitive function at baseline and  two year follow-up. Cognitive reserve moderated this association longitudinally.  Findings suggest that maintaining a socially active lifestyle in later life may  enhance cognitive reserve and benefit cognitive function. This has important  implications for interventions that may target social isolation to improve cognitive  function.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0201008","","8","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30118489  PMCID: PMC6097646","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Linear Models; *Cognition; Healthy Aging/psychology; Cognitive Aging/*psychology; *Cognitive Reserve; Social Isolation/*psychology; Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autonomic responding reflected by  heart rate variability (HRV) has well-established links to general health and  wellbeing in younger populations; but has yet to be explored in older individuals.  METHODS: Forty-five healthy participants (49-82 years old) completed questionnaires  about sleep and physical and psychological health. Autonomic activity was measured  during rest and whilst completing a computerised battery of cognitive tasks.  Participants then wore an ambulatory heart rate monitor overnight, and recorded  their sleep and physical activity for one week. HRV parameters reflecting cardiac  vagal tone were derived from electrocardiograph recordings. RESULTS: Age and resting  HRV were not related; however a positive association was identified between higher  HRV in the 2 h prior to sleep and older age. Higher resting HRV, older age, and  better sleep quality significantly predicted psychological wellbeing; and fewer  somatic and physical health symptoms and older age predicted better average sleep  quality ratings. Older age and poorer general health were significant predictors of  cognitive performance deficits. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an  age-related decline in HRV is not inevitable. Longitudinal designs exploring  within-individual changes in cardiac vagal tone are required to better understand  the factors contributing to healthy ageing.","2019-01-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","101-103","","","275","","Int J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The recruitment for the NFS started in October 2016. Participants are recruited based on an index person who is actively participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study.

If a set of family members agreed to participate, access to individualized web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, other health related lifestyle habits, eating behaviour, food responsiveness, personality, self-regulation, socio-economic status and socio-cultural values was provided. In the first phase of the NSF, recruitment rates were monitored in detail and participants' comments were analysed in order to improve the feasibility of procedures and instruments.Discussion: Until August 4th 2017, 4783 EPIC-Participants were contacted by mail of which 446 persons recruited 2 to 5 family members (including themselves) resulting in 1032 participants, of whom 82% had started answering or already completed the questionnaires. Of the 4337 remaining EPIC-participants who had been contacted, 1040 (24%) did not respond at all, and 3297 (76%) responded but declined, in 51% of the cases because of the request to recruit at least 2 family members in the respective age range. The developed recruitment procedures and web-based methods of data collection are capable to generate the required study population including the data on individual and inter-personal determinants which will be linkable to food choice. The information on familial links among the study participants will show the role of familial traits in midlife for the adoption of food choices supporting healthy aging.","2018-08-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:36:34","","963","","1","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30075718  PMCID: PMC6090749","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; Prospective Studies; Internet; Scales; Epidemiologic Research Design; *Determinants; *Food choice; *NutriAct family study; *Study protocol; Diet/*psychology; Eating/*psychology; Food Preferences/*psychology; Siblings/*psychology; Spouses/*psychology; Middle Age; Epidemiological Research; Diet -- Psychosocial Factors; Food Preferences; Eating -- Psychosocial Factors; Siblings -- Psychosocial Factors; Spouses -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN AND METHODS: Τhe ATTICA is a prospective, population-based study  conducted in the greater metropolitan area of Athens (Attica, Greece). During  2001-2002, 3042 CVD-free adults (men/women: 1514/1528, 18-89 years) agreed to  participate. In 2011-2012, the 10-year study follow-up was performed, recording the  fatal/non-fatal CVD incidence in 2020 participants (mean follow-up: 8.41 years).  Various bio-clinical characteristics [including low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol  (LDL-C), Lp(a)] were derived through standard procedures. Dietary habits were  assessed through the MedDietScore (an index assessing adherence to the Mediterranean  diet with theoretical range 0-55). A validated successful aging index (SAI), ranging  from 0 to 10, was used to assess healthy aging. RESULTS: Lp(a) levels were  positively associated with 10-year CVD incidence (Hazard Ratio: 1.02, 95%CI  1.01-1.04); when MedDietScore was included in the model the observed association  between Lp(a) levels and CVD risk disappeared (1.00, 95%CI 0.98-1.01), and a  mediating effect of Mediterranean diet was revealed (Sobel's test p < 0.001). In the  model that included both MedDietScore and SAI, the interaction effect of these two  features on 10-year CVD risk was highly protective (p < 0.001), whereas the  association between Lp(a) levels and CVD risk was further mediated (Sobel's test  p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, like the  Mediterranean diet seems to mediate the association between Lp(a) with CVD risk  whereas a successful aging together with a healthy diet seems to further explain the  previously mentioned association.","2018-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","33-37","","","60","","Clin Biochem","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

There is no test for TIA, with classification often reliant on  subjective, retrospective report. Functional brain measures such as the  electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful in objectively detecting and describing  the pathophysiology of TIA, but this has not been adequately examined. METHODS: EEG  was obtained from a single electrode over the left frontal lobe during 3-minute  resting-state and auditory oddball conditions administered to consecutive patients  within 72 hours of admission to the acute stroke ward of a tertiary hospital.  Separately, patients were classified by their treating team as having suffered  either an ischemic stroke (n = 10) or a TIA (n = 10). Relative power of delta,  theta, alpha, and beta EEG frequency bands were extracted for comparison between the  2 clinical groups and an existing normative sample of 10 healthy, age-, gender-, and  education-matched older adults. RESULTS: Analysis of variance with post hoc testing  identified pronounced delta activity in stroke patients, while alpha and beta power  were elevated in TIA patients. Both patient groups exhibited attenuated theta  activity compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve  analysis identified thresholds for each EEG frequency capable of distinguishing the  3 participant groups. CONCLUSIONS: TIA, ischemic stroke, and healthy aging are each  associated with distinct electrophysiological profiles. These preliminary findings  suggest that acute EEG may be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiology and  reversibility of TIA symptoms, and further exploration of the value of this unique  functional brain data is encouraged.","2019-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","196-204","","3","50","","Clin EEG Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 30045636","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; Brain/*physiopathology; ROC Curve; *Electroencephalography/methods; acute EEG; Brain Ischemia/diagnosis/*physiopathology; cerebrovascular disease; Ischemic Attack, Transient/diagnosis/*physiopathology; quantitative electroencephalogram; stroke; Stroke/physiopathology/therapy; transient ischemic attack","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is currently  unclear to what extent these hallmarks associate with symptoms of disease at extreme  ages. Forty centenarians from the 100-plus Study cohort donated their brain.  Centenarians self-reported to be cognitively healthy at baseline, which was  confirmed by a proxy. Objective ante-mortem measurements of cognitive performance  were associated with the prevalence, distribution and quantity of age- and  AD-related neuropathological hallmarks. Despite self-reported cognitive health,  objective neuropsychological testing suggested varying levels of ante-mortem  cognitive functioning. Post-mortem, we found that neuropathological hallmarks  related to age and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Aβ and Tau pathology, as well  as atherosclerosis, were abundantly present in most or all centenarians, whereas  Lewy body and pTDP-43 pathology were scarce. We observed that increased pathology  loads correlated across pathology subtypes, and an overall trend of higher pathology  loads to associate with a lower cognitive test performance. This trend was carried  especially by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar  degeneration (GVD) and to a lesser extent by Aβ-associated pathologies. Cerebral  Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) specifically associated with lower executive functioning in  the centenarians. In conclusion, we find that while the centenarians in this cohort  escaped or delayed cognitive impairment until extreme ages, their brains reveal  varying levels of disease-associated neuropathological hallmarks, some of which  associate with cognitive performance.","2018-07-23","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","64","","1","6","","Acta Neuropathol Commun","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30037350  PMCID: PMC6055341","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Mental Status Schedule; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Healthy aging; Autopsy; Amyloid beta-Peptides/metabolism; Positron-Emission Tomography; Aging/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; *Alzheimer’s disease; *Self Report; *Neuropathology; *100-plus Study; *Clinicopathological correlation; *Cognitively healthy centenarians; alpha-Synuclein/metabolism; Casein Kinase Idelta/metabolism; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*psychology; DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism; tau Proteins/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive impairment in late life is attributed to vascular and lifestyle related risk factors in mid-life in a substantial proportion of cases (50%), thereby providing an opportunity for effective prevention of cognitive decline if incipient disease is detected earlier. Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack (TIA) commonly display some degree of cognitive impairment and are at a 4-fold increased risk of dementia. In the Predementia Neuroimaging of Transient Ischemic Attack (PREVENT) study, we will address what disease processes (i.e., Alzheimer's vs. vascular disease) lead to neurodegeneration, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline, and whether imaging measurements of brain iron accumulation using quantitative susceptibility mapping predicts subsequent brain atrophy and cognitive decline.Methods: A total of 440 subjects will be recruited for this study with 220 healthy subjects and 220 TIA patients. Early Alzheimer's pathology will be determined by cerebrospinal fluid samples (including tau, a marker of neuronal injury, and amyloid β1-42) and by MR measurements of iron accumulation, a marker for Alzheimer's-related neurodegeneration. Small vessel disease will be identified by changes in white matter lesion volume. Predictors of advanced rates of cerebral and hippocampal atrophy at 1 and 3 years will include in vivo Alzheimer's disease pathology markers, and MRI measurements of brain iron accumulation and small vessel disease. Clinical and cognitive function will be assessed annually post-baseline for a period of 5-years using a clinical questionnaire and a battery of neuropsychological tests, respectively.Discussion: The PREVENT study expects to demonstrate that TIA patients have increased early progressive rates of cerebral brain atrophy after TIA, before cognitive decline can be clinically detected. By developing and optimizing high-level machine learning models based on clinical data, image-based (quantitative susceptibility mapping, regional brain, and white matter lesion volumes) features, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, PREVENT will provide a timely opportunity to identify individuals at greatest risk of late-life cognitive decline early in the course of disease, supporting future therapeutic strategies for the promotion of healthy aging.","2018-07-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:16:00","","163","","1","18","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 30012102  PMCID: PMC6048817","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Human; Scales; Brain -- Pathology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Aging; *Cognition; Neuroimaging; Canada; *Alzheimer’s disease; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/pathology; *Magnetic resonance imaging; *Neurodegeneration; *Small vessel disease; *Vascular dementia; Atrophy/pathology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/*etiology/psychology; Ischemic Attack, Transient/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*psychology; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*psychology; Middle Age; Atrophy -- Pathology; Cerebral Ischemia, Transient; Cerebral Ischemia, Transient -- Pathology; Cerebral Ischemia, Transient -- Psychosocial Factors; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neurodegenerative Diseases -- Pathology; Neurodegenerative Diseases -- Psychosocial Factors; Neuroradiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-sectional relation between MPS and White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, caudate atrophy, and global cerebral atrophy in a large cohort of Neurologically and Cognitively Healthy (NCH) aging individuals. Method: 1,219 NCH individuals were included in the analysis, and underwent standard brain MRI. The items of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale were used to evaluate tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait/balance/axial dysfunction. Caudate atrophy and global cerebral atrophy were assessed through the bicaudate ratio and the lateral ventricles to brain ratio, respectively. WMH were assessed through two visual rating scales. Lacunes were also rated. Associations of MPS with vascular risk factors/diseases and imaging findings were determined through the logistic regression analysis. Results: Frontal and basal ganglia lacunes, frontal WMH, caudate atrophy, and global cerebral atrophy were associated with bradykinesia. Basal ganglia lacunes, caudate atrophy, and global cerebral atrophy were associated with gait/balance/axial dysfunction. Rigidity was associated with frontal WMH, and tremor with caudate atrophy and global cerebral atrophy. NCH subjects with MPS, performed less than subjects without MPS in tests evaluating global cognition and language. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that in NCH aging individuals, MPS are associated with cortical and subcortical vascular and atrophic changes, and are probably, a warning sign of incipient cognitive decline. Subjects with MPS should manage rigorously cerebral SVD to prevent future physical and cognitive disabilities.

Data were collected from January 13, 1971, through December 31, 2009, and analyzed from October 6, 2015, through August 14, 2017. Participants included generally healthy men and women who presented for preventive medicine examinations at midlife and who were eligible for Medicare from 1999 to 2010. Those with a self-reported history of depression, myocardial infarction, or stroke at examination were excluded.Exposures: Objective midlife fitness estimated from results of treadmill exercise testing.Main Outcomes and Measures: Depression diagnosis from Medicare claims files using established algorithms and CVD mortality from National Death Index records.Results: A total of 17 989 participants (80.2% men) with a mean (SD) age of 50.0 (8.7) years were included. After 117 218 person-years of Medicare follow-up, 2701 depression diagnoses, 610 deaths due to CVD without prior depression, and 231 deaths due to CVD after depression were observed. A high level of fitness in midlife was associated with a 16% lower risk of depression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95) compared with a low level of fitness. A high fitness level was also associated with a 61% lower risk of death due to CVD without depression (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.31-0.48) compared with a low level of fitness.

Therefore, the aim of the present study  was to assess the long-term association between perceived job insecurity and SRH,  after controlling for baseline levels of health status and life-style choices.  Furthermore, three different follow-up periods (14, 19 and 24 years) were  considered. METHODS: Data were derived from the prospective population-based  MONICA/KORA cohort study (southern Germany). N = 4356 participants (2622 men and  1734 women), aged between 25 and 64 years at baseline, were included in the sample,  mean follow-up was after 19.1 years. Job insecurity, SRH and risk factors were  assessed at baseline during three independent surveys (1984-1995). SRH was  additionally assessed in 2009. The association of job insecurity and impaired SRH at  follow-up was estimated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall,  perceiving job insecurity at baseline was significantly associated with a 20% higher  risk of developing impaired SRH at follow-up in the pooled analysis (OR = 1.20, 95%  CI = 1.01-1.43, p = .034), even after controlling for baseline SRH,  socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, clinical and work-related factors. The  association was strongest and significant after 14 years (OR = 1.58, 95% CI  1.17-2.13, p = .003) and weaker and not significant to 19 (OR = 1.20, 95% CI  0.89-1.62, p = .24) and 24 years (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.73-1.32, p = .89) of follow-up  in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: We found that perceived job insecurity  during working life was independently and significantly associated with impaired SRH  both cross-sectionally as well as after 14 years, but not after 19 and 24 years.","2018-06-18","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","754","","1","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29914437  PMCID: PMC6006929","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Prospective Studies; Perception; Germany; *Successful aging; *Epidemiology; *Diagnostic Self Evaluation; *Job insecurity; *SRH; *Work-related stressors; *Working population; Employment/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a population-based longitudinal cohort study and examined  whether stairs in the home were associated with capability to perform instrumental  activities of daily living (IADL) in community-dwelling high-functioning older  adults. METHODS: The target population was individuals aged 65 years or older living  in two municipalities in Nara Prefecture in Japan. At the baseline survey, residents  who were independent in IADL (n = 6722) were included as survey subjects. Subjects  were divided into three groups according to their home type; one-storey residences,  walk-up residences, or residences with an elevator. IADL was evaluated using the  Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Multiple logistic  regression analyses stratified by gender were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR)  and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for a decline in IADL, with one-storey residences  as a reference. Age, studied area, marital status, working status, self-perceived  economic status, body mass index, chronic diseases, smoking, drinking, eating  habits, basic activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, depression,  self-rated health, and social participation were used as covariates. RESULTS: During  the 3-year follow-up, 11.6% of the subjects showed a decline in IADL. After  adjusting for covariates, women who lived in walk-up residences had a lower risk for  IADL decline (adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.52-0.99), while living in a home with  an elevator was not associated with IADL decline (adjusted OR = 0.94, 95%  CI = 0.49-1.77). In contrast, there was no association between home type and IADL  decline in men (walk-up residences, adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.71-1.14;  residences with an elevator, adjusted OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.39-1.72). CONCLUSIONS:  The presence of stairs in the home was associated with prevention of IADL decline  over a 3-year period in older women without disabilities. Although a barrier-free  house is recommended for older people, our findings indicate that a home with stairs  may maintain the capability to perform IADL among older adults without disabilities.","2018-06-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","132","","1","18","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29898678  PMCID: PMC6001070","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; *Successful aging; Cognition/physiology; Japan/epidemiology; Independent Living/*psychology/trends; Stair Climbing/*physiology; *Older people; Activities of Daily Living/*psychology; *Environment Design/trends; *Home type; *Instrumental activities of daily living; *Stairs; Disabled Persons/psychology; Social Participation/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: to verify these trends during 2001-16 in an older Swedish  population. METHODS: functional status was assessed at three occasions: 2001-04 (n =  2,266), 2007-10 (n = 2,033) and 2013-16 (n = 1,476), using objectively measured  balance, chair stands and walking speed. Point prevalence was calculated and  trajectories of change in impairment/vital status were assessed and were  sex-adjusted and age-stratified: 66; 72; 78; 81 and 84; 87 and 90. RESULTS: point  prevalence of impairment was significantly lower at the 2013-16 assessment than the  2001-04 in chair stand amongst age cohorts 78-90 years, and in walking speed amongst  age cohorts 72-84 years (P < 0.05), but not significantly different for balance. The  prevalence remained stable between 2001-04 and 2007-10, while the decrease in chair  stands and walking speed primarily occurred between 2007-10 and 2013-16. Among  persons unimpaired in 2007-10, the proportion of persons who remained unimpaired in  2013-16 tended to be higher, and both the proportion of persons who became impaired  and the proportion of persons who died within 6 years tended to be lower, relative  to corresponding proportions for persons unimpaired in 2001-04. Overall, there were  no corresponding changes for those starting with impairment. CONCLUSIONS: our  results suggest a trend towards less functional impairment in older adults in recent  years.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.  SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a long-running longitudinal cohort  study of healthy aging. PATIENTS: Eligible participants were aged ≥ 60 years and had  both vestibular physiological testing and brain magnetic resonance imaging at the  same visit. INTERVENTION: Vestibular function testing consisted of the cervical  vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) to assess saccular function, ocular  VEMP to assess utricular function, and video head-impulse testing to assess the  horizontal semicircular canal vestibulo-ocular reflex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:  Hippocampal volume calculated using diffeomorphometry. RESULTS: The study sample  included 103 participants (range of 35-90 participants in subanalyses) with mean  (±SD) age 77.2 years (±8.71). Multivariate linear models including age, intracranial  volume, sex, and race showed that 1 μV amplitude increase of cVEMP was associated  with an increase of 319.1 mm (p = 0.003) in mean hippocampal volume. We did not  observe a significant relationship between ocular VEMP amplitude or vestibulo-ocular  reflex gain and mean hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Lower cVEMP amplitude (i.e.,  reduced saccular function) was significantly associated with lower mean hippocampal  volume. This is in line with previous work demonstrating a link between saccular  function and spatial cognition. Hippocampal atrophy may be a mechanism by which  vestibular loss contributes to impaired spatial cognition in older adults. Future  work using longitudinal data will be needed to evaluate the causal nature of the  association between vestibular loss and hippocampal atrophy.","2018-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:22:19","","765-771","","6","39","","Otol Neurotol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29889787  PMCID: PMC5999049","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- pathology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Hippocampus -- pathology; Aging/*pathology; Baltimore; Hippocampus/*pathology; Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials/*physiology; Vestibular Function Tests; Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thanks to prolonged life expectancy and reduced infant mortality,  extended families that comprise four generations, co-residential or not, are no  longer rare in China. The current study examines health consequences when Chinese  grandparents provide care to not only grandchildren but also their own elderly  parents or parents-in-law (i.e., great-grandparents). Drawing on data from the  2011-2013 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), mental health was  captured by levels of life satisfaction and depressive symptoms, and physical health  was measured by levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), hypertension,  high-risk pulse rate, and diabetes. Overall grandparents who cared for grandchildren  only had better mental and physical health, compared with non-caregivers. There was  some evidence that the 'sandwich' grandparents who cared for both grandchildren and  great-grandparents reported greater life satisfaction, fewer depressive symptoms,  and reduced hypertension compared with non-caregivers. The health advantage of  caregiving was most pronounced in urban grandfathers whose caregiving conformed to  the norm of filial piety and who did so most likely to seek emotional reward instead  of an intergenerational time-for-money exchange. In contrast, rural grandmothers  were the most vulnerable group and their health disadvantage seemed to arise from  caring for great-grandparents. These findings highlight the importance of  rural-urban context and gender role in studying the health effects of  intergenerational caregiving on Chinese grandparents.","2019-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","106-116","","","229","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AD-associated odorants (AD-10) were selected based on a model of ordinal logistic regression. Age-associated odorants (Age-10) were identified using a linear model.Results: For the 841 participants (234 HA, 192 aMCI, 415 AD), AD-10 was superior to Age-10 in separating HA and AD. AD-10 was associated with a more widespread cognitive deficit across multiple domains, in contrast to Age-10. The disease- and age-associated odorants clustered separately in age and AD. AD-10 predicted conversion from aMCI to AD.Conclusions: Nonoverlapping UPSIT items were identified that were individually associated with age and disease. Despite a modest predictive value of the AD-specific items for conversion to AD, the AD-specific items may be useful in enriching samples to better identify those at risk for AD. Further studies are needed with monomolecular and unilateral stimulation and orthogonal biomarker validation to further refine disease- and age-associated signals.","2018-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:24:35","","835-846","","8","26","","Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

HS was measured using a dynamometer with the dominant hand. Functional measures included chair, tandem, and single leg stands. Two 24-hour recalls were collected using the US Department of Agriculture Automated Multiple Pass Method. The total protein intake and diet quality, evaluated by adherence to the DASH eating plan and Healthy Eating Index-2010, were calculated. Biomarkers included nutritional anemia, and serum levels of albumin, cholesterol, magnesium, and glucose.Results: The mean ±SE age of the sample was 52.3±0.2 years. Approximately 61% were African American and 57% were women. The mean ±SE HS of women was 29.1±0.2kg and for men was 45.9±0.4 kg. Protein, gm, per kg body weight for the women was 0.94±0.02 compared to 1.16 ±0.02 for men. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, hypertension, and diabetes, HS/BMI ratio was significantly associated with protein intake per kg body weight (p<0.001) and diet quality, assessed by either the DASH adherence (p=0.009) or Health Eating Index-2010 (p=0.031) scores. For both men and women, participants in the upper tertile of HS maintained a single leg and tandem stances longer and completed 5 and 10 chair stands in shorter time compared to individuals in the lower HS tertile. Of the nutritional status indicators, the percent of men in the upper HS tertile with low serum magnesium and albumin, was significantly lower than those in the lower HS tertile [magnesium,7.4% vs 16.1%; albumin, 0.4% vs 4.5%]. The only difference observed for women was a lower percent of diabetes (14.4% for the upper HS tertile compared to 20.5% for the lower HS tertile.Conclusions: The findings confirm the role of protein and a healthful diet in the maintenance of muscle strength. In this community sample, HS was significantly associated with other physical performance measures but did not appear to be strongly associated with indicators of nutritional risk. These findings support the use of HS as a proxy for functional status and indicate the need for research to explore its role as a predictor of nutritional risk.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:44:11","","700-709","","6","22","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29806859  PMCID: PMC5984956","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutritional Status; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; African Americans; United States; Prospective Studies; Body Weight; Hypertension -- physiopathology; Urban Population; Hand Strength -- physiology; Health Status Indicators; 97C5T2UQ7J; Cholesterol; Cholesterol -- blood; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Scales; Nutritive Value; *diet quality; Diet, Healthy/*methods; *Handgrip strength; *Nutritional Status; African American; Diabetes Mellitus; diet quality; Blood Glucose/analysis; Hand Strength/*physiology; Cholesterol/blood; *protein; Dietary Proteins/*analysis; *African American; *body mass index; Diet/methods; Hypertension/physiopathology; Magnesium/blood; Blood Glucose; Diet -- methods; Blood Glucose -- analysis; Diet, Healthy -- methods; body mass index; Dietary Proteins; Dietary Proteins -- analysis; Handgrip strength; I38ZP9992A; Magnesium; Magnesium -- blood; protein; Middle Age; Biological Markers; Functional Status; Nutritional Assessment; Food Intake; Cholesterol -- Blood; DASH Diet; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Albumins -- Blood; Anemia, Iron Deficiency; Black Persons -- In Adulthood; Dynamometry; Exercise Test; Grip Strength; Hypertension -- Risk Factors; Magnesium -- Blood; One Leg Stand; United States Department of Agriculture; White Persons -- In Adulthood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Data from the Health Aging  and Body Composition study (N = 3075, aged 70-79 at baseline) were used previously  to conduct a longitudinal latent class analysis to evaluate depression trajectories  (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale) over 10 years.  Restricting to the subset of subjects who had hearing information available  (N = 1204), self-reported hearing categories were evaluated over the same period.  Association between depression classes and hearing categories were assessed via  multinomial logistic regression analyses. Correlation analyses and two-sample  t-tests were used to assess cross-sectional associations between depression status  and audiometric hearing measures. RESULTS: Low-probability (N = 644),  increasing-probability (N = 385), and high-probability (N = 175) trajectories of  depressive symptoms were identified for the 10-year period. Impaired/Worsening  (N = 182) and Healthy/Improving (N = 1,022) hearing categories were defined using  self-reports. With the low-probability depression trajectory as the reference group,  subjects reporting Impaired/Worsening hearing had 1.63 times increased odds of  having an increasing- (p = 0.0088, 95% CI [1.13, 2.34]) and 1.85 times increased  odds of having a high-probability depression trajectory (p = 0.0102, 95% CI [1.16,  2.96]). At Year 5, individuals with depressive symptoms (10CES-D ≥ 10) had impaired  hearing ability measured by audiometric threshold for low-frequency (Adjusted mean  difference = 2.29 dBHL, p = 0.0005) and mid-frequency sounds (Adjusted mean  difference = 2.28 dBHL,p = 0.0049) compared to those with 10CES-D < 10.

However, few longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between brain  volume changes and cognition over a long follow-up period in healthy elderly women.  In the present study we investigate the relationship between whole brain and  hippocampal atrophy rates and longitudinal changes in cognition, including verbal  episodic memory and executive function, in older women. We also examine whether  baseline brain volume predicts subsequent changes in cognitive performance over a  10-year period. A total of 60 individuals from the population-based Women's Healthy  Ageing Project with a mean age at baseline of 59 years underwent 3T MRI. Of these,  40 women completed follow-up cognitive assessments, 23 of whom had follow-up MRI  scans. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between brain  atrophy and changes in verbal episodic memory and executive function over a 10-year  period. The results show that baseline measurements of frontal and temporal grey  matter volumes predict changes in verbal episodic memory performance, whereas  hippocampal volume at baseline is associated with changes in executive function  performance over a 10-year period of follow-ups. In addition, higher whole brain and  hippocampal atrophy rates are correlated with a decline in verbal episodic memory.  These findings indicate that in addition to atrophy rate, smaller regional grey  matter volumes even 10 years prior is associated with increased rates of cognitive  decline. This study suggests useful neuroimaging biomarkers for the prediction of  cognitive decline in healthy elderly women.","2019-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:13:27","","554-563","","2","13","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29744801","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Memory; Prospective Studies; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Cognition; Executive Function; Healthy Volunteers; Brain/*physiopathology; *Aging/physiology/psychology; Executive function; Elderly women; Hippocampus/*pathology; Atrophy/*pathology; Brain atrophy; Cognitive Dysfunction/physiopathology; Episodic memory; Gray Matter/*pathology; Hippocampal atrophy; Memory, Episodic; Normal aging; Middle Age; Atrophy -- Pathology; Brain -- Physiopathology; Gray Matter -- Pathology; Hippocampus -- Pathology; Research Subjects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants aged 50 to 60 years at baseline were more likely to engage  in aerobic PA ≥1 day/week than participants aged 61 to 78 years; OR 1.88, 95% CI  1.46 to 2.40. Participants with middle and high socioeconomic status (SES) were more  likely to engage in aerobic PA ≥1 day/week than participants with low SES; OR middle  SES 2.08, 1.33 to 3.25; high SES 3.44, 2.11 to 5.60. Participants with high social  support were more likely to engage in aerobic PA ≥1 day/week at follow-up than  participants with low social support; OR 1.98, 1.26 to 3.12. Furthermore,  participants who engaged in leisure time PA at least once per week at baseline were  more likely to engage in aerobic PA ≥1 day/week at follow-up than those who engaged  less than once per week; OR 1.95, 1.46 to 2.60. CONCLUSIONS: Several influencing  factors assessed at baseline predicted regular aerobic PA participation 12 years  later. These factors should be considered when planning interventions to prevent  physical inactivity in older adults. There is great potential to increase aerobic PA  participation in older adults in Germany, in particular among those with low SES and  low social support.","2018-05-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e021940","","5","8","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We examined two strategic time  points during the task-first, the crossover point where the velocity of the center  of mass (CoM) in the vertical dimension outstripped the velocity in the  anteroposterior dimension and secondly, the time to peak of the CoM velocity  profile. Transitions to stabilizing postures occur at these time points. They both  occurred earlier in aging subjects. The crossover point also showed adjustments with  target distance in aging subjects, while this was not observed in younger subjects.  The shifts in these key time points could not be attributed to differences in  movement duration between the two groups. Investigation with an optimal control  model showed that the temporal adjustment as a function of target distance in the  healthy aging subjects fits into a strategy that emphasized equilibrium maintenance  rather than absolute work as a control strategy.","2018-11-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:58:07","","1609-1617","","12","73","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29741585","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Reference Values; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Performance -- physiology; Psychomotor Performance; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Biomechanical Phenomena; Healthy Volunteers; Healthy Aging/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; *Task Performance and Analysis; Motor Skills/*physiology; Movement; Postural Balance/*physiology; Posture/physiology; Kinematics; Motor Skills; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Motor Skills -- physiology; Postural Balance -- physiology; Posture -- physiology; Task Performance and Analysis; Research Subjects; Balance, Postural -- Physiology; Posture -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured the frequency of moderate-to-severe  vasomotor symptoms (msVMS) in women ≥60 years of age and examined their  characteristics to determine factors that may associate with VMS in older women.  METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was completed using the Menopause Health  Questionnaire from the Data Registry on Experiences of Aging, Menopause, and  Sexuality. Data were collected from women presenting for menopause consultation to  Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from January 1, 2006 to October 7, 2014. We created a  binary variable where women were classified as having msVMS bother if they reported  ""quite a bit"" or ""extremely"" compared with women reporting ""not at all"" or ""a little  bit."" Women with and without msVMS were evaluated by menopause type, self-rated  heath, current tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use, as well as pertinent medication  use. Associations between participant characteristics and msVMS were evaluated using  logistic regression and a multivariable model with age as a covariate. Interactions  between participant characteristics and age were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the  4,956 women presenting for menopause consultation, 921 (18%) were ≥60 years old. Of  these, 379 (41.2%) reported msVMS bother. Women with msVMS were more likely to have  a history of nonspontaneous menopause and report their health as fair, versus good  or excellent. Women reporting current use of hormone therapy (HT) (21%) were less  likely to report msVMS compared with those not taking HT (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A  substantial number of women seen in a specialty menopause clinic were over age 60  years and reported msVMS, highlighting that VMS may be disruptive in women over a  decade past the natural age of menopause.","2018-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:22:27","","1105-1109","","10","25","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29738420","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Logistic Models; Multivariate Analysis; Healthy Aging; Registries; Marital Status; *Registries; Anxiety/complications; Caffeine/adverse effects; Hot Flashes/*epidemiology; Hysterectomy/adverse effects; Menopause/*physiology; Sweating/*physiology; Vasomotor System/physiopathology; 3G6A5W338E; Anxiety -- complications; Caffeine; Caffeine -- adverse effects; Hot Flashes -- epidemiology; Hysterectomy -- adverse effects; Menopause -- physiology; Sweating -- physiology; Vasomotor System -- physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, ability to switch between general and specific, as well as between positive  and negative retrieval, may be more important for the strategic use of  autobiographical information in everyday life. Ability to switch between retrieval  modes is likely to rely on aspects of executive function. We propose that  age-related deficits in cognitive flexibility impair AMS, but the ""positivity  effect"" protects positively valenced memories from impaired specificity. A training  programme to improve the ability to flexibly retrieve different types of memories in  depressed adults (MemFlex) was examined in non-depressed older adults to determine  effects on AMS, valence and the executive functions underlying cognitive  flexibility. Thirty-nine participants aged 70+ (MemFlex, n = 20; control, n = 19)  took part. AMS and the inhibition aspect of executive function improved in both  groups, suggesting these abilities are amenable to change, although not  differentially affected by this type of training. Lower baseline inhibition scores  correlated with increased negative, but not positive AMS, suggesting that positive  AMS is an automatic process in older adults. Changes in AMS correlated with changes  in social problem-solving, emphasising the usefulness of AMs in a social  environment.","2018-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1310-1322","","9","26","","Memory","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29733760","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cognition/*physiology; *ageing; *intervention; Healthy Aging/*psychology; *Resilience, Psychological; *autobiographical memory; *Memory, Episodic; Executive Function/*physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; *depression; Depression/psychology; *Cognitive flexibility; *Inhibition, Psychological; Cues; Emotions/physiology; Problem Solving; Social Skills","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to characterize 9-year changes in a HAI and explore their relationship to subsequent mortality.Methods: Data are from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study of well-functioning adults aged 70-79 years. A HAI, which ranges from 0 to 10, was constructed at years 1 and 10 of the study including systolic blood pressure, forced expiratory volume, digit symbol substitution test, cystatin C, and fasting glucose. The relationships between the HAI at years 1 and 10 and the change between years and subsequent mortality until year 17 were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models.Results: Two thousand two hundred sixty-four participants had complete data on a HAI at year 1, of these 1,122 had complete data at year 10. HAI scores tended to increase (i.e. get worse) over 9-year follow-up, from (mean [SD]) 4.3 (2.1) to 5.7 (2.1); mean within-person change 1.5 (1.6). After multivariable adjustment, HAI score was related to mortality from year 1 (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.17 [1.13-1.21] per unit) and year 10 (1.20 [1.14-1.27] per unit). The change between years was also related to mortality (1.08 [1.02-1.15] per unit change).Conclusions: HAI scores tended to increase with advancing age and stratified mortality rates among participants remaining at year 10. The HAI may prove useful to understand changes in health with aging.","2019-04-23","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:29:12","","726-732","","5","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2018.

METHOD: Using latent growth  mixture modeling and the ORANJ BOWL dataset, we examined prospective trajectories of  depression among older adults (mean age, 60.67; SD, 6.86) who were exposed to the 2  events. We also collected community economic and criminal justice data to examine  their impact upon depression trajectories. Participants (N=1172) were assessed at 3  times for affect, successful aging, and symptoms of depression. We additionally  assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology after Hurricane Sandy.  RESULTS: We identified 3 prospective trajectories of depression. The majority  (83.6%) had no significant change in depression from before to after these events  (resilience), while 7.2% of the sample increased in depression incrementally after  each event (incremental depression). A third group (9.2%) went from high to low  depression symptomology following the 2 events (depressive-improving). Only those in  the incremental depression group had significant PTSD symptoms following Hurricane  Sandy. CONCLUSION: We identified a small group of individuals for whom the  experience of multiple stressful events had an incremental negative effect on mental  health outcomes.

In this study, we examined age trajectories of cognitive decline in a large  nationally representative sample of older people in England. We explored the factors  that influence such decline and whether these differed by gender. METHODS: Latent  growth curve modelling was used to explore age-specific changes, and influences on  them, in an 8-year period in memory, executive function, processing speed and global  cognitive function among 10 626 participants in the English Longitudinal Study of  Ageing. We run gender-specific models with the following exposures: age, education,  wealth, childhood socioeconomic status, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, physical  function, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, depression and  dementia. RESULTS: After adjustment, women had significantly less decline than men  in memory (0.011, SE 0.006), executive function (0.012, SE 0.006) and global  cognitive function (0.016, SE 0.004). Increasing age and dementia predicted faster  rates of decline in all cognitive function domains. Depression and alcohol  consumption predicted decline in some cognitive function domains in men only. Poor  physical function, physical inactivity and smoking were associated with faster rates  of decline in specific cognitive domains in both men and women. For example,  relative to study members who were physically active, the sedentary experienced  greater declines in memory (women -0.018, SE 0.009) and global cognitive function  (men -0.015, SE 0.007 and women -0.016, SE 0.007).

CMV antibodies, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein  [CRP], soluble interferon-α/β receptor) and T cell phenotypes were assessed before  ART (V0) and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (V1-V12). CMV DNA was detected in 41  patients (52%) at V0, irrespective of CD4 T cell counts, gender, age, or plasma HIV  RNA. CMV DNA+ patients had higher levels of antibody reactive with CMV Immediate  Early 1 (IE-1) at V0 and V12 (p = 0.04), and with CMV lysate at V12 (p = 0.01).  Detectable CMV DNA did not align with inflammatory markers, but associated with  lower CD4/CD8 ratios until V3. CMV antibody levels correlated inversely with  proportions of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells, and directly with proportions of CD57(+)  and activated memory T cells (CD3(+) CD45RA(-)) after 3-12 months on ART. Overall,  active CMV replication is common in HIV patients beginning ART in Indonesia and  associates with low CD4/CD8 ratios. Elevated levels of CMV-reactive antibody  measured on ART also mark a depletion of naive T cells, accumulation of memory T  cells, and may be a stable metric of the burden of CMV.","2018-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","472-479","","6","31","","Viral Immunol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29688840","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Young Adult; Indonesia/epidemiology; *HIV; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; *antiretroviral therapy; *CMV; *Indonesia; *T cells; Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Antibodies, Viral/*blood; Cytomegalovirus Infections/blood/epidemiology/*immunology/virology; Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/isolation & purification/*physiology; DNA, Viral/isolation & purification; HIV Infections/blood/*drug therapy/immunology; T-Lymphocytes/*immunology; Viral Load/drug effects/immunology; Virus Replication/drug effects/immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cortical thickness was greater in multiple  regions in SA including right anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex and was  related to baseline memory performance. Similarly, hippocampal volume was greater in  SA and associated with baseline memory. SA also had lower white matter hypointensity  volumes and faster processing speed. While PiB burden did not differ, there was a  significant group interaction in the relationship between age and PiB such that  older SA individuals were less likely to have high brain β-amyloid. Over time,  memory performance in typical older adults declined more rapidly than in SA,  although there was limited evidence for different rates of brain atrophy. These  findings indicate that superior memory in aging is related to greater cortical and  white matter integrity as well as slower decline in memory performance.","2018-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:57:38","","162-170","","","67","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma immune marker levels of  healthy and demented individuals have yielded conflicting results. We analyzed CSF  from 101 members of the parental history-positive PREVENT-AD cohort of healthy aging  adults, and 237 participants without dementia from the initial cohort of the  Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1). Following recent practice, we  used the biomarkers total-tau and amyloid-β1-42 to allocate participants from each  study into four stages of AD pathogenesis: Stage 0 (no abnormality), Stage 1  (reduced amyloid-β1-42), Stage 2 (reduced amyloid-β1-42 and increased total-tau), or  ""Suspected Non-Alzheimer Pathology"" (elevated total-tau only). Investigating the  PREVENT-AD participants' CSF assay results for 19 immune/inflammatory markers, we  found six that showed a distinct bi-directional relationship with pathogenetic  stage. Relative to Stage 0, these were diminished at Stage 1 but strongly increased  at Stage 2. Among the ADNI participants (90 healthy controls and 147 with mild  cognitive impairment), we found that 23 of 83 available CSF markers also showed this  distinct pattern. These results support recent observations that immune activation  may become apparent only after the onset of both amyloid and tau pathologies.  Unexpectedly, they also suggest that immune marker activity may diminish along with  earliest appearance of amyloid-β plaque pathology. These findings may explain  discordant results from past studies, and suggest the importance of characterizing  the extent of AD pathology when comparing clinical groups.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:56:25","","577-590","","2","63","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29660934  PMCID: PMC5929310","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Apolipoproteins E; Apolipoproteins E -- genetics; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease -- pathology; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; Human; Scales; Apolipoproteins; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; inflammation; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides/*cerebrospinal fluid; tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid; *biomarkers; *Alzheimer’s disease; *inflammation; biomarkers; *pathology; Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/*immunology/pathology; Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid; Inflammation/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/*immunology; Peptide Fragments/*cerebrospinal fluid; Inflammation; Alzheimer Disease -- genetics; tau Proteins; Alzheimer Disease -- cerebrospinal fluid; Alzheimer Disease -- immunology; Amyloid beta-Peptides -- cerebrospinal fluid; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); Biomarkers -- cerebrospinal fluid; Inflammation -- cerebrospinal fluid; Inflammation -- genetics; Inflammation -- immunology; MAPT protein, human; pathology; Peptide Fragments; Peptide Fragments -- cerebrospinal fluid; tau Proteins -- cerebrospinal fluid; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease -- Pathology; Barthel Index; Alzheimer's Disease -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Alzheimer's Disease -- Immunology; Inflammation -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Inflammation -- Immunology; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Peptides -- Cerebrospinal Fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

China is experiencing a rapid aging transition, with physical activity an important routine in many older people's lives. This study utilizes the Health Belief Model to better understand the bidirectional relationships and bipolar effects between physical activity and chronic disease burden in Huainan City, a mid-sized city in China.Methods: Longitudinal health survey data (2010-2015) from annual clinic visits for 3198 older people were obtained from a local hospital, representing 97% of the older population in three contiguous neighborhoods in Huainan City. The chronic diseases studied included obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases, liver and biliary system diseases, and poor kidney function. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine differences in physical activity levels across socio-demographic groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the impacts of physical activity practice levels on chronic disease onsets. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effects of chronic disease diagnosis on physical activity practice levels.Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases increased with increasing age, among men, and those with a lower education. Older people who were physically active experienced a later onset of chronic disease compared to their sedentary counterparts, particularly for obesity and diabetes. Following diagnosis of a chronic disease, physically active older people were more likely to increase their physical activity levels, while sedentary older people were less likely to initiate physical activity, demonstrating bipolar health trajectory effects.Conclusions: Health disparities among older people may widen as the sedentary experience earlier onsets of chronic diseases and worse health trajectories, compared to physically active people. Future health education communication and programmatic interventions should focus on sedentary and less healthy older populations to encourage healthy aging. These lessons from China may be applied to other countries also experiencing an increasing aging population.","2018-04-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:21:25","","486","","1","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29650011  PMCID: PMC5898068","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Health Surveys; Aged, 80 and Over; *Health Status Disparities; *Aging; Cities; China; China/epidemiology; Health Status Disparities; *China; *Physical activity; Exercise/*psychology; *Longitudinal analysis; *Chronic diseases; *Health belief model; Chronic Disease/*epidemiology; Middle Age; Surveys; Urban Areas; Chronic Disease -- Epidemiology; Exercise -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Widowhood is a salient life transition that can affect older adults'  cognitive function. Leisure engagement has received increasing attention because it  is still modifiable in later life to help prevent cognitive decline. Nonetheless,  limited longitudinal studies have examined how widowhood influences cognitive  function, and even fewer studies have tested the role of leisure activities in this  relationship. METHOD: This study delineated the mechanism of widowhood, leisure  activity engagement, and cognitive function among older adults using a national  longitudinal dataset, the Health and Retirement Study, and its supplementary  dataset, the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, which repeatedly measured  individuals' leisure activity engagement. RESULTS: Findings showed no significant  association between widowhood and cognitive function during a 4-year period.  However, engagement in mental activities moderated the impact of widowhood on  cognitive function. Specifically, the benefit of mental activity engagement on  cognition was more pronounced among individuals who were recently widowed compared  to those who were married. This implies a protective role of mental activities in  the relationship between widowhood and cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Interventions  with mentally stimulating activities at the community level to retain cognition  among individuals in early phase widowhoodare suggested. Future studies are  necessary to explore whether other factors such as changes in physical and mental  health and intergenerational support from adult children during widowhood may  further influence this mechanism among widowhood, leisure activities, and cognitive  function.","2019-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","771-780","","6","23","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29634291","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; United States; *Cognition; Leisure Activities/*psychology; Depression; *Bereavement; *cognitive functioning; *cognitive stimulation; *Consumption and Activities Mail Survey; *leisure activities; Marriage/*psychology; Widowhood/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depression is a robust risk factor for dementia but it is unknown if this holds true  for individuals with T1D, who recently started living to an age conferring dementia  risk. We examined if depression is a dementia risk factor among elderly individuals  with T1D. METHODS: 3,742 individuals with T1D age ≥50 were followed for dementia  from 1/1/96-9/30/2015. Depression, dementia, and comorbidities were abstracted from  electronic medical records. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association  between depression and dementia adjusting for demographics, glycosylated hemoglobin,  severe dysglycemic epidsodes, stroke, heart disease, nephropathy, and end stage  renal disease. The cumulative incidence of dementia by depression was estimated  conditional on survival dementia-free to age 55. RESULTS: Five percent (N = 182)  were diagnosed with dementia and 20% had baseline depression. Depression was  associated with a 72% increase in dementia (fully adjusted HR = 1.72; 95%  CI:1.12-2.65). The 25-year cumulative incidence of dementia was more than double for  those with versus without depression (27% vs. 12%).

Previous studies have shown FGF-23 to be a risk factor for incident end-stage renal disease; however, there are less data on the association of FGF-23 with earlier kidney-related outcomes.Methods: Serum FGF-23 was assayed using an intact ELISA assay in 2,496 participants of the Healthy Aging and Body Composition Study, a cohort of well-functioning older adults. Kidney function was estimated by assaying cystatin C at baseline and years 3 and 10. The associations between FGF-23 and decline in kidney function (defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline ≥30% or ≥3 mL/min/year) and incident chronic kidney disease (CKD; incident eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≥1 mL/min/year decline) were evaluated. Models were adjusted for demographics, baseline eGFR, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, comorbidity, and serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D and parathyroid hormone.Results: The mean (SD) age was 75 (3) years, with 52% female and 38% black. There were 405 persons with 30% decline, 702 with >3 mL/min/year decline, and 536 with incident CKD. In fully adjusted continuous models, doubling of FGF-23 concentrations was not associated with kidney function decline (OR [95% CI] = 0.98 [0.82-1.19] for ≥30% decline and OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.00-1.37] for ≥3 mL/min/year decline), or incident CKD (incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.05 [95% CI 0.91-1.22]). In adjusted quartile analysis, the highest quartile of FGF-23 was significantly associated with incident CKD (IRR 1.27 [95% CI 1.02-1.58] for highest vs. lowest quartile).Conclusion: Higher FGF-23 concentrations were not consistently associated with decline in kidney function or incident CKD in community-dwelling older adults.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:59:04","","242-250","","4","47","","Am J Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 S.

METHODS: Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (N =  12,034), we apply, separately by gender, multichannel sequence analysis and cluster  analysis to obtain groups of similar family and employment histories. The KHB method  is used to disentangle direct and indirect effects of early-life conditions on  health. RESULTS: Early-life-conditions indirectly impact on health in later life as  result of their influence on education and family and employment trajectories. For  example, between 22% and 42% of the effect of low parental socio-economic status at  childhood on the three considered health outcomes at older age is explained by  educational attainment for women. Even higher percentages are found for men (35% -  57%). On the contrary, the positive effect of poor health at childhood on poor  health at older ages is not significantly mediated by education and life-course  trajectories. Education captures most of the mediating effect of parental  socio-economic status. More specifically, between 66% and 75% of the indirect effect  of low parental socio-economic status at childhood on the three considered health  outcomes at older age is explained by educational attainment for women. Again,  higher percentages are found for men (86% - 93%). Early-life conditions, especially  socioeconomic status, influence family and employment trajectories indirectly  through their impact on education. We also find a persistent direct impact of  early-life conditions on health at older ages.

A convenience sample of elderly individuals fulfilling clinical criteria of either  AD (n = 28) or moderate and severe depression (n = 37) was recruited from different  settings to assess the potential of the pattern recognition method to assist in the  differential diagnosis of AD versus depression.

The  algorithm also identified consistent structural differences in a clinically more  relevant scenario where the data used during training were independent from the data  used for evaluation and, critically, which included five possible diagnoses  (specifically AD, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, depression, and  healthy aging). While the output was insufficiently accurate to use it directly as a  means for classification when multiple classes are possible, the continuous output  computed by the machine learning algorithm differed between the two groups that were  investigated. The automated analysis thus could complement, but not replace clinical  assessments.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","353-363","","1","63","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29614658  PMCID: PMC5900555","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Retrospective Studies; *magnetic resonance imaging; Machine Learning; ROC Curve; *Alzheimer’s disease; *depression; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; *supervised machine learning; *support vector machine; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnostic imaging; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Depression/*diagnostic imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Higher physical activity and lower  body mass index were both independently associated with less functional decline. The  greatest risk reductions were found among those with higher protein intakes combined  with either higher physical activity, more skeletal muscle mass, or lower body mass  index.

Although many long-term care facilities now operate for older adults, the transition  from the home environment to long-term facilities may cause multiple issues,  including relocation stress syndrome, for new residents. Autonomy is a critical  element of the human experience. Leisure, as an expression of autonomy, has been  shown to enhance self-image and promote feelings of competence and mastery. PURPOSE:  The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between participation in  leisure activities and adjustment to residential care using the continuity theory.  METHODS: One hundred sixty-three qualified individuals from 11 long-term care  institutions were recruited and completed the questionnaire. The sampling criteria  for the study were age (55+ years), appropriate cognitive skills, and residency  (less than 5 years). Interviews conducted by trained interviewers were used to  collect data. Measured outcomes included leisure participation; physical,  psychological, and social adjustments; and background information. Cluster analysis,  descriptive analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and least significant  difference test were used in analysis. RESULTS: Type of admission  (voluntary/mandated) and type of leisure participation significantly affected the  level of relocation adjustment success. Four leisure behavior categories were  identified, including reduced participation, expanded participation, active  participation, and continuing participation. The participants in the active and  continuing participation categories had significantly higher psychological  adjustment than their peers in the reduced participation category. Moreover, the  continuing participation category had a significantly better level of social  adjustment than their expanded participation category peers. Continuous and active  participation categories had a beneficial outcome in relocation adjustment.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings support that, in general, residents of long-term care  facilities who participate continuously in leisure activities adjust better  psychologically and socially to their new life in these facilities than individuals  in the other participation categories. As continuity of participation in leisure  activities is important for successful aging, institutions should facilitate the  continuing leisure behavior of new residents.","2018-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","427-437","","6","26","","J Nurs Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: China (Republic : 1949- ) PMID: 29557819","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Taiwan; Quality of Life/*psychology; Leisure Activities/*psychology; *Self Concept; *Adaptation, Psychological; Homes for the Aged/statistics & numerical data; Long-Term Care/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Nursing Homes/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although declines in each are associated with numerous negative outcomes, the longitudinal relationship between these two measures is unclear. Objective: to examine the dynamic, bidirectional associations between declines in PF and PA. Design: prospective cohort. Setting: the Monongahela--Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) study. Subjects: about 1,404 men and women, 76.96 ± 7.2 years, 62.4% female and 95.2% white. Methods: over nine annual assessment cycles, PF was evaluated via the timed Up-and-Go task and PA via a self-reported questionnaire. Piecewise latent growth models examined bidirectional associations between PA and PF to determine whether the initial values (intercept) or early slope (cycles 1--5) (in either PF or PA) predicted later slope (cycles 5--9)(ineitherPForPA). Results: initial PF significantly predicted early (standardised β = -0.10, P < 0.001) and later (standardised β = -0.09, P = 0.01) PA slopes. Initial PA significantly predicted later (standardised β = -0.09, P = 0.04) but not early PF slope. Associations were independent of baseline memory test scores, baseline cognitive status, later cognitive status and age. Early physical function slope neither predicts later PA slope nor did early PA slope predict later PF slope (both P values >0.10). Conclusions: the relationship between PF and PA is bidirectional, with PF more consistently predicting declines of PA, both in the short- and long-term. Intervening on PF impairments may improve PA engagement, which could in turn promote PF and translate to beneficial effects on cognitive function, cardiovascular health and mood.","2018-07-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:39:07","","558-564","","4","47","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2018.

We aimed to develop a multi-protein signature of delirium by identifying proteins associated with delirium from unbiased proteomics and combining them with delirium biomarkers identified in our prior work (interleukin [IL]-6 and IL-2).Methods: We used the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) Study of adults age ≥70 undergoing major noncardiac surgery (N = 560; 24% delirium). Plasma was collected preoperatively (PREOP) and on postoperative day 2 (POD2). In a nested matched case-control study involving 12 pairs of delirium cases and no-delirium controls, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-based (iTRAQ) mass spectrometry proteomics was applied to identify the top set of delirium-related proteins. With these proteins, we then conducted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmation, and if confirmed, ELISA validation in 75 matched pairs. Multi-marker conditional logistic regression was used to select the ""best"" PREOP and POD2 models for delirium.Results: We identified three proteins from iTRAQ: C-reactive protein (CRP), zinc alpha-2 glycoprotein (AZGP1), and alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (SERPINA3). The ""best"" multi-protein models of delirium included: PREOP: CRP and AZGP1 (Bayesian information criteria [BIC]: 93.82, c-statistic: 0.77); and POD2: IL-6, IL-2, and CRP (BIC: 87.11, c-statistic: 0.84).Conclusion: The signature of postoperative delirium is dynamic, with some proteins important before surgery (risk markers) and others at the time of delirium (disease markers). Our dynamic, multi-protein signature for delirium improves our understanding of delirium pathophysiology and may identify patients at-risk of this devastating disorder that threatens independence of older adults.","2019-01-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:39:55","","261-268","","2","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29529166  PMCID: PMC6333936","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Biomarkers/blood; Disease Progression; C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism; Cytokines/*blood; Delirium/*blood/etiology; Elective Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects; Postoperative Complications/*blood; Proteomics/*methods; C-Reactive Protein -- Metabolism; Cytokines -- Blood; Delirium -- Blood; Delirium -- Etiology; Postoperative Complications -- Blood; Surgery, Elective -- Adverse Effects; Proteomics -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seventy-eight (16 carriers) had at least one follow-up (every 2  years). Changes in intra- and internetwork FCs among the default mode (DMN),  executive control (ECN), and salience (SN) networks, as well as cognition, were  quantified using linear mixed models. Cross-sectionally, APOE-ɛ4 carriers had lower  functional connectivity between the ECN and SN than noncarriers. Carriers also  showed a stronger age-dependent decrease in visuospatial memory performance.  Longitudinally, carriers had steeper increase in inter-ECN-DMN FC, indicating loss  of functional segregation. The longitudinal change in processing speed performance  was not moderated by APOE-ɛ4 genotype, but the brain-cognition association was. In  younger elderly, faster loss of segregation was correlated with greater decline in  processing speed regardless of genotype. In older elderly, such relation remained  for noncarriers but reversed for carriers. APOE-ɛ4 may alter aging by accelerating  the change in segregation between high-level cognitive systems. Its modulation on  the longitudinal brain-cognition relationship was age-dependent.","2018-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2742-2752","","7","39","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 29520911  PMCID: PMC6866329","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Age Factors; *healthy aging; Cognition/*physiology; Nerve Net/diagnostic imaging/*physiology; Aging/genetics/*physiology; Apolipoproteins E/*genetics; *APOE-ɛ4; *functional MRI; *functional segregation; *intrinsic connectivity networks; *longitudinal study; Apolipoprotein E4/genetics; Connectome/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study consisted of (1) baseline cross-sectional analyses examining correlates of global cognition (n = 248) among socio-clinico-demographic factors and (2) longitudinal analyses examining baseline predictors for changes of global cognition in 3-year follow-up (n = 195). The Mini-Mental State Examination was used as a screening test to assess global cognition.Results: At baseline, higher weights were related to higher cognitive function in the oldest-old. The baseline predictors of global cognitive decline in 3-year follow-up were higher global cognition, shorter education period, and lower sociocultural activities and lower instrumental activity of daily living, in this order.Conclusions: The present study suggests that it is crucial to attain higher education during early life and avoid leanness or obesity, participate in sociocultural cognitive activities during late life, and maintain instrumental activity of daily living to preserve optimal cognitive function in the oldest-old, which will facilitate developing prevention strategies for cognitive decline and promoting successful aging in this increasing population.","2018-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:05:27","","926-933","","7","33","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29514399","","","","Humans; Cognition; Female; Male; Social Environment; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Japan; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Demography; Social Behavior; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Independent Living; *cognitive function; Aging/physiology; *physical function; *Cognition/physiology; *instrumental activity of daily living; *social activity; *the oldest-old; Body Weight/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction/physiopathology/prevention & control; Tokyo; Community Living; Body Weight -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIM:  This study aims to compare the effects of multicomponent exercise and different  pharmacological treatments on functional status and cardiovascular risk outcomes in  hypertensive older adults with comorbidities. METHODS: Participants (n = 96) engage  in a 3 days/week multicomponent (aerobic + resistance) exercise program and for one  of the following three conditions: (1) thiazide-related diuretics (TDs; n = 33,  69.9 ± 9.5 years); (2) calcium channel blockers (CCBs; n = 23, 67.0 ± 9.0 years);  (3) and β-blockers (βBs; n = 40, 65.6 ± 7.2 years) medication.

RESULTS: All groups have significantly  improved the physical functional status; particularly upper and lower body strength  and aerobic endurance and systolic blood pressure. The TDs and βBs groups have  diminished the waist circumference and body mass. The CCBs decreased total  cholesterol (P = 0.028), perceived better physical functioning, physical component  score but also augmented bodily pain (P < 0.05).

We hypothesized that ECG global electric heterogeneity (GEH) and its longitudinal changes are associated with cardiac structure and function.Methods and Results: Participants from the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) (N=5114; 58% female; 22% blacks) with resting 12-lead ECGs (visits 1-5) and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV global longitudinal strain, LV mass index, LV end-diastolic volume index, and LV end-systolic volume index at visit 5 were included. Longitudinal analysis included ARIC participants (N=14 609) with measured GEH at visits 1 to 4. GEH was quantified by spatial ventricular gradient, QRS-T angle, and sum absolute QRS-T integral. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regressions were adjusted for manifest and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Having 4 abnormal GEH parameters was associated with a 6.4% (95% confidence interval, 5.5-7.3) LV ejection fraction decline, a 24.2 g/m2 (95% confidence interval, 21.5-26.9) increase in LV mass index, a 10.3 mL/m2 (95% confidence interval, 8.9-11.7) increase in LV end-diastolic volume index, and a 7.8 mL/m2 (95% confidence interval, 6.9-8.6) increase in LV end-systolic volume index. Altogether, clinical and ECG parameters accounted for approximately one third of LV volume and 20% of systolic function variability. The associations were significantly stronger in cardiovascular disease. Sum absolute QRS-T integral increased by 20 mV*ms for each 3-year period in participants who demonstrated LV dilatation at visit 5. Sudden cardiac death victims demonstrated rapid GEH worsening, whereas those with LV dysfunction demonstrated slow GEH worsening. Healthy aging was associated with a distinct pattern of spatial ventricular gradient azimuth decrement.Conclusions: GEH is a marker of subclinical abnormalities in cardiac structure and function.","2018-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:00:59","","e005961","","3","11","","Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 29496680  PMCID: PMC5836803","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Ventricular Function, Left/*physiology; Disease Progression; Risk Assessment/*methods; Stroke Volume/*physiology; *atherosclerosis; *dilatation; *electrocardiography; *hypertrophy, left ventricular; *vectorcardiography; Atherosclerosis/*diagnosis/physiopathology; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography/*methods; Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology; Myocardial Contraction/*physiology; Vectorcardiography/methods; Middle Age; Stroke Volume -- Physiology; Atherosclerosis -- Diagnosis; Atherosclerosis -- Physiopathology; Electrocardiography -- Methods; Heart Ventricle; Heart Ventricle -- Physiopathology; Myocardial Contraction -- Physiology; Risk Assessment -- Methods; Vectorcardiography -- Methods; Ventricular Function, Left -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of oxidative stress biomarkers has  been increasingly examined in the context of pathological aging conditions that  affect cognition. Plasma F(2)-Isoprostane levels are a reliable index of systemic  oxidative stress (specifically lipid peroxidation) and are elevated in dementia  patients. Less is known about their role in healthy cognitive ageing. This study  evaluated the relationship between F(2)-Isoprostanes and cognitive functioning in a  cohort of 211 healthy elderly adults (60-75 years: Male; 88, Female; 123). Cognitive  assessment included the Cognitive Drug Research (CDR) computerised assessment  battery, which produces five validated factor scores (corresponding to 'Quality of  Episodic Memory', 'Speed of Memory', Quality of Working Memory', Power of Attention'  and 'Continuity of Attention'). Participants with higher F(2)-Isoprostane levels had  significantly lower Quality of Episodic Memory scores (suggesting inferior abilities  in retaining and retrieving verbal information in episodic memory). This is, to our  knowledge, the first report of compromised verbal episodic memory in healthy ageing  humans being linked to increased levels of F(2)-Isoprostanes.

A quasi-experimental pre-test post-test study was performed. The  intervention group (n = 411; mean age = 76.75; SD = 7.75) was assessed at baseline,  three months, and six months. Data of comparable older adults who completed the  original Active Plus intervention served as reference group (n = 87; mean age =  74.36; SD = 6.26). Multilevel regression analyses were applied: outcome measures  were weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and days per  week with at least 30 minutes of MVPA. Although Active Plus65 did not outperform the  original intervention, in itself Active Plus65 effectuated a significant increase in  the weekly minutes of MVPA (B = 208.26; p < 0.001; Effect Size (ES) = 0.45) and in  the days per week with sufficient MVPA (B = 1.20; p < 0.001; ES = 0.61) after three  months. After six months, it effectuated a significant increase in the days per week  with sufficient MVPA (B = 0.67; p = 0.001; ES = 0.34) but not for the weekly minutes  of MVPA (p = 0.745). As Active Plus65 increased MVPA at three months with a higher  ES than average interventions for this vulnerable target group, it potentially makes  an interesting intervention.

This study aimed to examine associations between transition into  statutory, disability and part-time retirement, and changes in health functioning.  METHODS: Survey data were collected among ageing employees of the City of Helsinki,  Finland, at three phases: (i) (2000-02), (ii) (2007) and (iii) (2012). Physical and  mental health functioning were measured using the Short-Form 36 questionnaire at  each phase. Retirees between phases 1 and 3 were identified from the national  registers of the Finnish Centre for Pensions: full-time statutory retirement (n =  1464), part-time retirement (n = 404), and disability retirement (n = 462).  Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the associations. RESULTS:  Disability retirees had poorer pre- and post-retirement health functioning compared  to statutory and part-time retirees. Statutory and part-time retirement were  associated with no or only small changes in physical health functioning during  retirement transition (β 0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5 and -1.0, -1.8 to -0.1,  respectively), whereas a clear decline in functioning was observed among disability  retirees (-4.3, -5.4 to -3.2). Mental health functioning improved during the  retirement transition among statutory and part-time retirees (1.9, 1.4-2.4 and 2.0,  1.0-3.0, respectively), whereas no change was observed for disability retirees.

Visit 1 occurred between 2004 and 2009; visit 2, between 2009 and 2013; there were 1.5 to 2.0 visits per participant.Main outcome and exposure measures: Cognitive performance was assessed using 11 test scores covering domains of global cognition, attention, learning/memory, executive function, visuospatial/visuoconstruction ability, psychomotor speed, and language/verbal. Serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D intake, and use of supplements containing vitamin D were the key exposures.Results: A consistent relationship was found between vitamin D status (overall) and supplemental intake (older women and black adults), with a slower rate of decline in the domain of verbal fluency. Higher dietary intake of vitamin D was linked to slower rate of decline in verbal memory among younger women, and a slower rate of decline in visual memory/visuoconstructive abilities among white adults. All other associations were inconsistent.Conclusions: Vitamin D status and intakes were inversely related to domain-specific cognitive decline in US urban adults.","2018-04-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:22:09","","1654-1668","","4","103","","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29409006  PMCID: PMC6276714","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Urban Population; Dietary Supplements; *Dietary Supplements; Cognition/*drug effects; Attention/drug effects; Cognitive Dysfunction/*blood/psychology; Executive Function/drug effects; Learning/drug effects; Reaction Time/drug effects; Vitamin D Deficiency/blood/*drug therapy/psychology; Vitamin D/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood; Middle Age; Vitamin D -- Blood; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Blood; Vitamin D; Attention -- Drug Effects; Cognition -- Drug Effects; Executive Function -- Drug Effects; Learning -- Drug Effects; Reaction Time -- Drug Effects; Vitamin D -- Administration and Dosage; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Drug Therapy; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research suggests that psychological variables influence the perception of  cognition, but whether they influence the accuracy of those perceptions (i.e.,  metacognition) has not been directly examined. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Using  Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we tested for discrete personality (NEOFFI) and mood  (STAI, BDI-II, and GDS) classes among a community-based cohort of 151 older adults,  enrolled in the NKI-Rockland study. Metamemory was calculated by comparing  subjective memory ratings (modified Cognitive Failures Questionnaire) to objective  memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) to determine the degree to which  individuals were overconfident, underconfident, or accurate in their  self-assessment. A generalized linear model was used to examine whether metamemory  differed across the emergent classes. A one sample t test was used to determine  whether the metamemory scores of the emergent classes were statistically  significantly different from zero, that is, over or under confident. RESULTS: Two  discrete classes emerged in the LCA: Class 1 was characterized predominantly by high  extraversion and conscientiousness and low neuroticism and anxiety; Class 2 was  characterized predominantly by low extraversion and conscientiousness and high  neuroticism and anxiety. Metamemory differed significantly as a function of Class  Membership (F(4,151)=5.42; p<.001), with Class 1 demonstrating accurate metamemory  (M=0.21; SD=1.31) and Class 2 demonstrating under-confidence (M=-0.59; SD=1.39) in  their memory.

METHODS: The aim of this study was  to evaluate the association of dietary sodium intake with cognitive decline in  community-dwelling older adults. We also evaluated the associations of dietary  potassium and sodium:potassium intake with cognitive decline, and associations of  these nutrients with micro- and macro-structural brain magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) indices. In all, 1,194 participants in the Health Aging and Body Composition  study with measurements of dietary sodium intake (food frequency questionnaire  [FFQ]) and change in the modified Mini Mental State Exam (3MS) were included.  RESULTS: The age of participants was 74 ± 3 years with a mean dietary sodium intake  of 2,677 ± 1,060 mg/day. During follow-up (6.9 ± 0.1 years), 340 (28%) had a  clinically significant decline in 3MS score (≥1.5 SD of mean decline). After  adjustment, dietary sodium intake was not associated with odds of cognitive decline  (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50-1.84 per doubling of sodium). Similarly, potassium was not  associated with cognitive decline; however, higher sodium:potassium intake was  associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR 2.02 [95% CI 1.01-4.03] per  unit increase). Neither sodium or potassium alone nor sodium:potassium were  associated with micro- or macro-structural brain MRI indices. These results are  limited by the use of FFQ. CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling older adults, higher  sodium:potassium, but not sodium or potassium intake alone, was associated with  decline in cognitive function, with no associations observed with micro- and  macro-structural brain MRI indices. These findings do not support reduction dietary  sodium/increased potassium intake to prevent cognitive decline with aging.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","57-65","","1","47","","Am J Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 S.

Cross-country comparative studies on survival among older  adults are limited. In addition, Japan, the country with the longest life  expectancy, is rarely included in these cross-country comparisons. OBJECTIVE: We  examined the relative contributions of social and behavioural factors on the  differences in survival among older people in Japan and England. METHODS: We used  data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES; n = 13,176) and the  English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA; n = 5,551) to analyse all-cause  mortality up to 9.4 years from the baseline. Applying Laplace regression models, the  15th survival percentile difference was estimated. RESULTS: During the follow-up,  31.3% of women and 38.6% of men in the ELSA died, whereas 19.3% of women and 31.3%  of men in the JAGES died. After adjusting for age and baseline health status, JAGES  participants had longer survival than ELSA participants by 318.8 days for women and  by 131.6 days for men. Family-based social relationships contributed to 105.4 days  longer survival in JAGES than ELSA men. Fewer friendship-based social relationships  shortened the JAGES men's survival by 45.4 days compared to ELSA men. Currently not  being a smoker contributed to longer survival for JAGES women (197.7 days) and ELSA  men (46.6 days), and having lower BMI reduced the survival of JAGES participants by  129.0 days for women and by 212.2 days for men. CONCLUSION: Compared to participants  in England, Japanese older people lived longer mainly because of non-smoking for  women and family-based social relationships for men. In contrast, a lower rate of  underweight, men's better friendship-based social relationships, and a lower smoking  rate contributed to survival among participants in England.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:57:53","","266-277","","3","64","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 S.

This study is focused on identifying groups of population with similar aging patterns, and to define the health trajectories of these groups. Sociodemographic and health determinants of these trajectories are also identified.Methods: Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used. A set of self-reported health items and measured tests were used to generate a latent health metric by means of a Bayesian multilevel IRT model, assessing the ability of the metric to predict mortality. Then, a Growth Mixture Model (GMM) was conducted in each study to identify latent classes and assess health trajectories. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for each class and a multinomial logistic regression was used to identify determinants of these trajectories.Results: The health score generated showed an adequate ability to predict mortality over 10 years in ELSA (AUC = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.75) and HRS (AUC = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.75). By means of GMM, four latent classes were identified in ELSA and five in HRS. Chronic conditions, no qualification and low level of household wealth were associated to the classes which showed a higher mortality in both studies.Conclusion: The method based on the creation of a common metric of health and the use of GMM to identify similar patterns of aging, allows for the comparison of trajectories of health across longitudinal surveys.

We estimated probability of high-risk levels across indictors of  health by TL and age-singly and jointly. TL was associated with seven indicators of  poor functioning: high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, cystatin C, pulse  pressure, body mass index, lung function, and walking speed. However, after  adjusting for age, associations were substantially attenuated; only associations  with cholesterol and lung function remained significant. Additionally, findings show  TL did not add to the predictive power of chronological age in predicting poor  functioning. While TL may not be a useful clinical marker of functional aging in an  older adult population, it may still play an important role in longitudinal studies  in young and middle aged populations that attempt to understand aging.","2018-11-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:48:23","","1626-1632","","12","73","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29346517  PMCID: PMC6230208","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Longevity -- genetics; Logistic Models; Physical Fitness -- physiology; Predictive Value of Tests; Retirement; *Quality of Life; Physical Fitness/*physiology; Healthy Aging/*genetics; Cognition Disorders/*genetics/physiopathology; Longevity/genetics; Telomere Shortening/*genetics; Telomere/genetics; Healthy Aging -- genetics; Cognition Disorders -- physiopathology; Cognition Disorders -- genetics; Telomere -- genetics; Telomere Shortening -- genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite mixed results in recent clinical trials, Relaxin-therapy  for 2-days could reduce mortality by 37% at 180-days post-treatment, in patients  with acute decompensated HF. Relaxin's short life-span (hours) but long-lasting  protective actions led us to test the hypothesis that relaxin acts at a genomic  level to reverse maladaptive remodeling in aging and HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Young  (9-month) and aged (24-month), male and female F-344/Brown Norway rats were treated  with relaxin (0.4 mg/kg/day) for 2-weeks delivered by subcutaneous osmotic  mini-pumps or with sodium acetate (controls). The genomic effects of aging and  relaxin were evaluated by extracting RNA from the left ventricles and analyzing  genomic changes by RNA-sequencing, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, MetaCore and tissue  immunohistochemistry. We found that aging promotes a native inflammatory response  with distinct sex-differences and relaxin suppresses transcription of multiple genes  and signaling pathways associated with inflammation and HF in both genders. In  addition, aging significantly increased: macrophage infiltration and atrial  natriuretic peptide levels in female ventricles, and activation of the complement  cascade, whereas relaxin reversed these age-related effects. CONCLUSION: These data  support the hypothesis that relaxin alters gene transcription and suppresses  inflammatory pathways and genes associated with HF and aging. Relaxin's suppression  of inflammation and fibrosis supports its potential as a therapy for cardiovascular  and inflammation-related diseases, such as HF, AF and diabetes.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:05:04","","e0190935","","1","13","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29346407  PMCID: PMC5773192","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Animals; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Cohort Studies; Age Factors; Rats; Disease Models, Animal; Biomarkers; Aging -- immunology; Biomarkers/metabolism; *Disease Models, Animal; Aging/*immunology; Atrial Fibrillation/metabolism; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Heart Failure/metabolism; Heart/*drug effects; Inflammation/*drug therapy; Macrophages/immunology; Rats, Inbred F344; Relaxin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Biomarkers -- metabolism; 9002-69-1; Atrial Fibrillation -- metabolism; Heart -- drug effects; Heart Failure -- metabolism; Inflammation -- drug therapy; Macrophages -- immunology; Relaxin; Relaxin -- pharmacology; Relaxin -- therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Histological and neuroimaging studies have implicated the hippocampal  region in neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. This  highly plastic limbic region is made up of several subregions that are believed to  have different functional roles. Therefore, there is a growing interest in imaging  the subregions of the hippocampal formation rather than modelling the hippocampus as  a homogenous structure, driving the development of new automated analysis tools.  Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand the stability of the measures  derived from these new techniques. In this study, an automated hippocampal subregion  segmentation pipeline, released as a developmental version of Freesurfer (v6.0), was  applied to T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 22 healthy older  participants, scanned on 3 separate occasions and a separate longitudinal dataset of  40 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Test-retest reliability of hippocampal  subregion volumes was assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC),  percentage volume difference and percentage volume overlap (Dice). Sensitivity of  the regional estimates to longitudinal change was estimated using linear mixed  effects (LME) modelling. The results show that out of the 24 hippocampal subregions,  20 had ICC scores of 0.9 or higher in both samples; these regions include the  molecular layer, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA3 and the subiculum  (ICC > 0.9), whilst the hippocampal fissure and fimbria had lower ICC scores  (0.73-0.88). Furthermore, LME analysis of the independent AD dataset demonstrated  sensitivity to group and individual differences in the rate of volume change over  time in several hippocampal subregions (CA1, molecular layer, CA3, hippocampal tail,  fissure and presubiculum). These results indicate that this automated segmentation  method provides a robust method with which to measure hippocampal subregions, and  may be useful in tracking disease progression and measuring the effects of  pharmacological intervention.","2018-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1743-1754","","4","39","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 29341323  PMCID: PMC6866454","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Reproducibility of Results; *brain structure; Organ Size; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Software; *FreeSurfer; *Healthy Aging/pathology; *hippocampal subfields; *hippocampus; *intraclass correlation coefficient; *linear mixed effects; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; *test-retest reliability; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Hippocampus/*diagnostic imaging/pathology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods; Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study  was to assess the effect of sex and neighborhood socio-economic status on the change  in health related quality of life (HR-QOL) as a function of physical activity over a  three-year period. METHODS: This cohort study included French-speaking  community-dwelling older adults recruited in primary care practices in the province  of Quebec and participating in the 'Étude sur la Santé des Ainés' (ESA)-Services  study on the health of the elderly. Primary care practices were recruited through  participating general practitioners (GPs) working full-time in the health  administrative region. A stratified sample was comprised of various types of primary  care practices (family medicine group, local community health services centers,  primary care practices with less than 3 GPs, and with at least 3 GPs). In this study  sample, 967 participants with scores ≥26 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)  were included and followed for 3 years to study HR-QOL as a function of reported  exercise at baseline and follow-up, controlling for study variables. Analyses were  also carried out to study the effect of change in reported exercise at follow-up  with respect to baseline and categorised as follows: no change, decrease in exercise  and increase in exercise. The interaction terms area of residence socio-economic  status*exercise and sex*exercise, were tested. RESULTS: Exercise at baseline did not  significantly predict HR-QOL at follow-up when adjusting for all other study  variables. Exercise at follow-up was cross-sectionally associated with follow-up  HR-QOL. Participants reporting never exercising and those reporting a decrease in  exercise reported a lower HR-QOL at follow-up, when controlling for all other study  variables. There was no interaction between exercise and sex and socioeconomic  status. CONCLUSIONS: For healthy ageing, maintaining and increasing physical  activity throughout the years is necessary for improved HR-QOL. Past physical  activity does not confer protection against future decline of HR-QOL. Future  research should focus on potential moderating and mediating psycho-social barriers  associated with exercising in older age populations.","2018-01-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:35:15","","15","","1","16","","Health Qual Life Outcomes","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29338743  PMCID: PMC5771011","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Health Surveys; Psychological Tests; Social Class; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Funding Source; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Exercise; *Social Class; Older adults; *Quality of Life; Physical activity; *Aging/physiology/psychology; Health related quality of life; Independent Living/psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Quebec; Community Living; Surveys; Community Living -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these  successes necessitate that we understand more about the pathways of ageing to plan  and cost our health and social care services, to support our ageing population to  live healthier for longer and to make adequate provisions for retirement.  Longitudinal studies of ageing facilitate such understanding in many countries  around the world. Scotland presently does not have a longitudinal study of ageing,  despite dramatic increases to its ageing population and its poor health record.  Healthy AGeing in Scotland (HAGIS) constitutes the launch of Scotland's first  comprehensive longitudinal study of ageing. METHODS: A sample of 1000 people aged  50+ years will be invited to take part in a household social survey. The innovative  sampling procedure used administrative data to identify eligible households.  Anonymised survey responses will be linked to administrative data. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the host institution for the study  design and from the Public Benefits and Privacy Panel for administrative data  linkage. Anonymised survey data will be deposited with the UK Data Service. A subset  of survey data, harmonised with other global ageing studies, will be available via  the Gateway to Global Aging platform. These data will enable powerful cross-country  comparisons across the social, economic and health domains that will be relevant for  national and international research.Research publications from the HAGIS team will  be disseminated through journal articles and national and international conferences.  The findings will support current and future research and policy debate on ageing  populations.","2018-01-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e018802","","1","8","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the time to death by SES, and levels of biomedical and psychosocial SA. Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted to explore interactions between SES and SA models while adjusting for gender, age, and marital status.Results: Lower levels of SES and biomedical and psychosocial SA were associated with low probability of survival. Only the interaction between SES and biomedical SA was significant. Biomedical SA impacted on mortality rates among individuals with low SES but not on those with medium or high SES, whereas psychosocial SA affected mortality regardless of SES.Conclusions: Promoting equal access to health care system and improved psychosocial well-being could be a protective factor against premature mortality in older Spanish adults with low SES.","2018-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:38:15","","259-268","","3","53","","Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 29322199","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Social Class; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Successful aging; Proportional Hazards Models; *Social Class; Spain; Cause of Death; *Cause of Death; *Mortality, Premature; *Biomedical well-being; *Psychosocial well-being; *Socioeconomic status; *Spain; *Survival analysis; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Middle Age; Regression; Impact of Events Scale; Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This effect was observed in the older group (age ≥54 years, β = 0.221, P = 0.004), but not in younger or entire sample (β = 0.018, P = 0.867 and β = 0.089, P = 0.098, respectively). Among major brain lobes, frontal CBF had the highest sensitivity in predicting future cognition, with a significant effect observed for fluid cognition (β = 0.244 P = 0.001), episodic memory (β = 0.294, P = 0.001), and reasoning (β = 0.186, P = 0.027). These associations remained significant after accounting for baseline cognition.

AD was computed for all fatal events and compared across 12 groups of causes of death. Multiple linear regression model was used to estimate AD and Cox model to predict each of the 12 causes of death, as a function of 28 selected baseline risk factors.Results: After 50 years, 97.5% of men had died. Mean AD was 75.0 years (median 76), while large variation was found across the 12 causes of death, with the highest levels for Heart Disease of Uncertain Etiology (HDUE) and Senility plus Causes Unknown (SNUNK), having means of 79.2 and 84.5 (median of 80 and 86) years, respectively. Many risk factors were directly associated with overall AD, the most significant being subscapular skinfold, arm circumference, Mediterranean diet, age at baseline examination, never smokers and vigorous physical activity. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was inversely related. The relevant modifiable risk factors predicting single causes of death were SBP and the lifestyle behaviors of dietary, motion and smoking habits.Conclusions: AD proved to be a useful indicator of previous health and aging of populations. HDUE and SNUNK seem the most “physiological” causes of death. SBP and lifestyle risk factors are the most relevant characteristics associated with AD.","2018-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:10","","901-911","","8","30","","Aging Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 29256065","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Diet; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Smoking; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Healthy Aging; Italy; Cause of Death; Blood Pressure/physiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; *Life Style; *Cause of Death; Risk factors; Italy/epidemiology; Rural Population; Age at death; Causes of death; Heart Diseases/epidemiology; Prediction; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Middle Age; Physical Activity; Arm Circumference; Heart Diseases; Mediterranean Diet; Mortality -- Risk Factors; Motion; Multiple Linear Regression; Rural Areas -- Italy; Skinfold Thickness; Systolic Pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Investigation of systemic metabolic state, multiorgan aging,  and long-term cardiovascular outcome in African Americans has not been reported.  METHODS: We studied 291 African American males in the Health, Aging, and Body  Composition (Health ABC) study to identify circulating metabolites related to the  Newman healthy aging index (HAI; a multiparametric score comprised of blood  pressure, blood glucose, neurocognitive function, creatinine, and forced vital  capacity). We examined the relationship of selected metabolites differential  abundant at the extremes of HAI with long-term survival from cardiovascular  mortality. RESULTS: The median age was 73 years. We identified 19 metabolites  differentially expressed in blood in 86 study participants at the extremes of HAI  (HAI 0-3: N = 30 vs 8-10: N = 56). At a median follow-up of 10 years, 78  participants (27 per cent) died from cardiovascular causes. After adjustment for  age, body mass index, presence of prevalent cardiovascular disease, creatinine, and  HAI, six of these 19 metabolites were associated with long-term cardiovascular  mortality. Although several metabolites had been previously reported in Caucasians  (eg, isocitrate), we identified several metabolites with unreported association with  cardiac disease. Metabolites associated with HAI and cardiac death in African  Americans specified pathways relevant to nitric oxide, oxidative stress,  mitochondrial function, urea cycle, and gut microbial metabolism. CONCLUSIONS:  Metabolite profiling in African Americans identified known and novel metabolic  pathways linked to HAI and cardiovascular death. Further investigation in larger  patient cohorts is required to uncover race-based signatures of cardiovascular  disease with aging.","2019-01-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","68-72","","1","74","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29253112  PMCID: PMC6298181","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Incidence; Retrospective Studies; United States/epidemiology; Biomarkers/blood; *Body Composition; Risk Assessment/*methods; *African Americans; Aging/ethnology/*metabolism; Blood Glucose/*metabolism; Cardiovascular Diseases/*ethnology/metabolism/physiopathology; Creatinine/*blood; Lost to Follow-Up; Survival Rate/trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of  this study is to identify and predict trajectories of functional decline over 9  years in males and females aged 60-70 years. METHODS: We included 403  community-dwelling participants from the InCHIANTI study and 395 from the LASA study  aged 60-70 years at baseline, of whom the majority reported no functional decline at  baseline (median 0, interquartile range 0-1). Participants were included if they  reported data on ≥2 measurements of functional ability during a 9-year follow-up.  Functional ability was scored with 6 self-reported items on activities of daily  living. We performed latent class growth analysis to identify trajectories of  functional decline and applied multinomial regression models to develop prediction  models of identified trajectories. Analyses were stratified for sex. RESULTS: Three  distinct trajectories were identified: no/little decline (219 males, 241 females),  intermediate decline (114 males, 158 females), and severe decline (36 males, 30  females). Higher gait speed showed decreased risk of functional limitations in males  (intermediate limitations, odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97; severe  limitations, OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.66). The final model in males further included  the predictors fear of falling and alcohol intake (no/little decline, area under the  receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.73; intermediate decline, AUC  0.63, 95% CI 0.56-0.69; severe decline, AUC 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.87). In females,  higher gait speed showed a decreased risk of intermediate limitations (OR 0.51, 95%  CI 0.38-0.68) and severe limitations (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.44). Other predictors  in females were age, living alone, economic satisfaction, balance, physical  activity, BMI, and cardiovascular disease (no/little decline, AUC 0.80, 95% CI  0.75-0.85; intermediate decline, AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.79; severe decline, AUC  0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99).

METHODS: Longitudinal cohort data from the Study of Women's Health  Across the Nation were used to examine AL patterns in midlife women ages 42-53  (n = 1,932). AL measures were created using 10 biomarkers representing  cardiovascular, inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and metabolic system functioning. We  used longitudinal random effects Poisson regression models to assess change in AL  over the 7-year follow-up period and associations between sociodemographic factors  and AL. RESULTS: On average, a woman's AL score increased 2% each year over the  course of the study. Baseline measures of African American race, low family income,  older age, and ability to read and speak only in English were significantly  associated with higher levels of AL over the study period. We did not observe  significant differences in rates of change in AL by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic  status. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that AL increases in a cumulative  manner as women age. Midlife is an especially important time in women's life course  with respect to health maintenance and healthy aging. AL can be an early warning  indicator of subsequent disease burden, pointing to subclinical conditions and the  need for implementation of medical and public health interventions earlier in the  disease process.","2018-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:15:44","","258-266","","3","28","","Womens Health Issues","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2018 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.

Because a ""loss of complexity""  (LOC) is a key phenomenon of the aging process that exhibits in multiple systems, we  propose the idea that age- and cognition-related LOC may also become manifested in  gait function. The LOC theory suggests that even healthy aging is associated with a  (neuro)physiological breakdown of system elements that causes a decline in  variability and an overall LOC. We used coordination dynamics as a conceptual  framework and hypothesized that a LOC is reflected in dynamic gait outcomes (e.g.  gait regularity, complexity, stability) and that such outcomes could increase the  specificity of the gait-cognition link. METHODS: 19 geriatric patients (age  80.0±5.8) were followed for 14.4±6.6 months. An iPod collected three-dimensional  (3D) trunk accelerations while patients walked for 3 minutes. Cognition was  evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seven-Minute screen  (7MS) test. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) quantified the magnitude of cognitive  change. Spearman's Rho coefficients (ρ) indexed correlations between baseline gait  and future cognitive change. RESULTS: Seven patients showed reliable cognitive  decline (""Cognitive Decline"" group), and 12 patients remained cognitively stable  (""Cognitive Stable"" group) over time. Future cognitive decline was correlated with a  more regular (ρ = 0.579*) and predictable (ρ = 0.486*) gait pattern, but not with  gait speed. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in gait regularity and predictability possibly  reflects a LOC due to age- and cognition-related (neuro)physiological decline.  Because dynamic versus traditional gait outcomes (i.e. gait speed and (variability  of) stride time) were more strongly correlated with future cognitive decline, the  use of wearable sensors in predicting and monitoring cognitive and physical health  in vulnerable geriatric patients can be considered promising. However, our results  are preliminary and do require replication in larger cohorts.","2018-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:33:49","","1301-1309","","9","30","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29223180","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Pilot Projects; *cognitive impairment; Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis; Geriatric Assessment/methods; *Gait; *frailty; *gait analysis; *geriatric patients; *loss of complexity; *non-linear dynamics; *prediction; Gait Disorders, Neurologic/*diagnosis/*psychology; Gait; Pilot Studies; Logistic Regression; Geriatric Assessment -- Methods; Gait Disorders, Neurologic -- Diagnosis; Gait Disorders, Neurologic -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the search for effective strategies to improve dietary patterns in order to promote  healthy ageing, new approaches considering contextual factors in public health  medicine are warranted. The aim of this study is to examine the spatial clustering  of dietary patterns in a large representative sample of adults. METHODS: Dietary  patterns were defined on the basis of a 111 item Food Frequency Questionnaire among  n = 117,570 adults using principal components analysis. We quantified the spatial  clustering of dietary pattern scores at the neighborhood level using the Global  Moran's I spatial statistic, taking into consideration individual demographic and  (neighborhood) socioeconomic indicators. RESULTS: Four dietary patterns explaining  27% of the variance in dietary data were extracted in this population and named the  ""bread and cookies"" pattern, the ""snack"" pattern, the ""meat and alcohol"" pattern and  the ""vegetable, fruit and fish"" pattern. Significant spatial clustering of high (hot  spot) and low (cold spot) dietary pattern scores was found for all four dietary  patterns irrespective of age and gender differences. Educational attainment and  neighborhood income explained the global clustering to some extent, although  clustering at smaller regional scales persisted. CONCLUSION: The significant  region-specific hot and cold spots of the four dietary patterns illustrate the  existence of regional ""food cultures"" and underscore the need for interventions  targeted at the sub-national level in order to tackle unhealthy dietary behavior and  to stimulate people to make healthy dietary choices.","2017-12-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","166","","1","14","","Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29212502  PMCID: PMC5719934","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Cluster Analysis; Adult; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; *Diet; Netherlands; *Environment; *Residence Characteristics; *Health Behavior; Diet Surveys; *Dietary patterns; *Food cultures; *Spatial analysis; Empirical Research; Patient Compliance; Principal Component Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have suggested  that social capital and networks may influence a person's risk of obesity. Yet, few  longitudinal studies have assessed whether social capital and networks reduce  obesity risk in adult populations. In this study, the data come from three waves  (2008, 2010, and 2013) of the Montreal Neighborhood Networks and Health Aging Panel  (N=2606). Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate body mass index  (BMI) with obesity defined as a BMI>30. Name and position generator instruments  captured network measures of social capital, including: (1) upper reachability, (2)  range, (3) diversity and (4) the number of kin ties. Questions on generalized trust  and participation were used to assess cognitive and structural dimensions of social  capital. Separate random effects logistic regression was used to examine the  association among social network characteristics, social capital, and obesity. We  found the greater the number of kin ties in a person's network, the greater the risk  of obesity (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.08-1.62). Adults with higher network diversity (OR:  0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.96) and high generalized trust (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.77)  were at a lower the risk of obesity. The current study confirmed that higher network  capital and trust were protective against obesity, while having kin ties was not.  Disentangling the multidimensional role that social capital plays can lead to more  effective interventions to reduce obesity.","2018-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:57:41","","366-370","","","111","","Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated whether electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of vSTM vary with  cognitive development over individuals' lifespan. We measured vSTM performance and  EEG in a lateralized whole-report task in a healthy birth cohort, whose cognitive  function (intelligence quotient) was assessed in youth and late-middle age. Higher  vSTM capacity (K; measured by Bundesen's theory of visual attention) was associated  with higher amplitudes of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the central  positivity (CP). In addition, rightward hemifield asymmetry of vSTM (K(λ)) was  associated with lower CDA amplitudes. Furthermore, more severe cognitive decline  from young adulthood to late-middle age predicted higher CDA amplitudes, and the  relationship between K and the CDA was less reliable in individuals who show higher  levels of cognitive decline compared to individuals with preserved abilities. By  contrast, there was no significant effect of lifespan cognitive changes on the CP or  the relationship between behavioral measures of vSTM and the CP. Neither the CDA,  nor the CP, nor the relationships between K or K(λ) and the event-related potentials  were predicted by individuals' current cognitive status. Together, our findings  indicate complex age-related changes in processes underlying behavioral and EEG  measures of vSTM and suggest that the K-CDA relationship might be a marker of  cognitive lifespan trajectories.","2018-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:50:52","","210-220","","","62","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is unknown whether increased delirium severity is associated with a higher rate  of long-term cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate delirium severity and the  presence and rate of cognitive decline over 36 months following surgery. METHODS: We  examined patients from the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery Study, who were  age ≥70 years undergoing major elective surgery (N = 560). Delirium severity was  determined by the peak Confusion Assessment Method-Severity (CAM-S) score for each  patient's hospitalization and grouped based on the sample distribution: scores of  0-2, 3-7, and 8-19. A neuropsychological composite, General Cognitive Performance  (GCP), and proxy-reported Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline (IQCODE)  were used to examine cognitive outcomes following surgery at 0, 1, and 2 months, and  then every 6 months for up to 3 years. RESULTS: No significant cognitive decline was  observed for patients with peak CAM-S scores 0-2 (-0.17 GCP units/year, 95%  confidence interval [CI] -0.35, 0.01). GCP scores decreased significantly in the  group with peak CAM-S scores 3-7 (-0.30 GCP units/year, 95% CI -0.51, -0.09), and  decreased almost three times faster in the highest delirium severity group (peak  CAM-S scores 8-19; -0.82 GCP units/year, 95% CI -1.28, -0.37). A similar association  was found for delirium severity and the proportion of patients who developed IQCODE  impairment over time. CONCLUSION: Patients with the highest delirium severity  experienced the greatest rate of cognitive decline, which exceeds the rate  previously observed for patients with dementia, on serial neuropsychological testing  administered over 3 years, with a dose-response relationship between delirium  severity and long-term cognitive decline.","2018","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:18:37","","347-358","","1","61","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29171992  PMCID: PMC5714669","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; cognition; Severity of Illness Index; Elective Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects; Cognitive Dysfunction/*etiology; delirium; Delirium/*surgery; dementia; Postoperative Complications/*physiopathology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- etiology; Delirium -- surgery; Elective Surgical Procedures -- adverse effects; Postoperative Complications -- physiopathology; Questionnaires; Clinical Assessment Tools; Delirium -- Surgery; Postoperative Complications -- Physiopathology; Surgery, Elective -- Adverse Effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It  has been shown associations between tooth loss and parental education and  occupation, independently of adult conditions. To explore the role of early  socioeconomic circumstances on tooth loss, we used a lifecourse model. We analysed  the direct and indirect links between early socioeconomic conditions and severe  adult tooth loss. METHODS: We used the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study  1945-1955 Retirement Cohort, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of  Costa Rican residents born between 1945 and 1955. We used imputed data on 2796  individuals. Principal component analyses were run to integrate measures approaching  the material circumstances during childhood and adulthood. We additionally examined  the role of adult health behaviours and education level as potential mediators in  the multivariable regression. RESULTS: Early socioeconomic conditions were found  strongly associated with severe tooth loss; 72.4% of the people who experienced the  most deprived socioeconomic conditions during childhood (quartile 1) had severe  tooth loss at the time of the interview; vs 43.3% in quartile 4 (most advantaged).  This link diminished after adjustment for adult mediators. However, it remained a  significant determinant of severe tooth loss in the final model. CONCLUSION: The  lifecourse model allowed to highlight that early socioeconomic conditions could have  long-term consequences on severe tooth loss in middle ages via both direct and  indirect mechanisms.","2018-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:50:08","","178-184","","2","46","","Community Dent Oral Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, current guidelines on physical activity are mainly aimed  at middle-aged adults. It is unclear whether physical activity also translates into  cardiovascular health benefits in older adults. Therefore, we aimed to compare the  association between different levels of physical activity and the risk of  cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly to middle-aged individuals. Methods We  analysed data from the EPIC Norfolk prospective population study. Cox proportional  hazards models were used to analyse the association between physical activity levels  and time to CVD events in three age categories (<55, 55-65 and >65 years).  Interaction between age categories and physical activity levels was assessed.  Results Analyses were based on 24,502 study participants aged 39-79 years. A total  of 5240 CVD events occurred during 412,954 person-years follow-up (median follow-up  was 18.0 years). Among individuals aged over 65 years, hazard ratios for CVD were  0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.96), 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.99) and 0.88 (95%  CI 0.77-1.02) in moderately inactive, moderately active and active people,  respectively, compared to inactive people. Among people aged 55-65 and less than 55  years, the associations were directionally similar, but not statistically  significant. The interaction term between physical activity levels and age  categories was not significant ( P = 0.38). Conclusion The inverse association  between physical activity and the risk of CVD was significant in elderly and  comparable with middle-aged individuals. In addition, we observed that modest levels  of physical activity confer benefits in terms of CVD risk, compared to being  completely inactive.","2018-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","200-208","","2","25","","Eur J Prev Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 29161890  PMCID: PMC5757406","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Adult; Health Status; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Prognosis; *Healthy Aging; *Exercise; *Risk Reduction Behavior; Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control; Protective Factors; *Physical activity; England/epidemiology; *cardiovascular disease; *Healthy Lifestyle; *elderly people; *middle-aged adults","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relationships between whole-brain connectivity, assessed using graph theory metrics,  and four major domains of cognitive ability (visuospatial reasoning, verbal memory,  information processing speed and crystallized ability) were investigated, as was the  mediating effects of WMH volume on these relationships. RESULTS: Visuospatial  reasoning was associated with network strength, mean shortest path length, and  global efficiency. Memory was not associated with any network connectivity metric.  Information processing speed and crystallized ability were associated with all  network measures. Some relationships were lost when adjusted for mean network FA.  WMH volume mediated 11%-15% of the relationships between most network measures and  information processing speed, even after adjusting for mean network FA. CONCLUSION:  Brain structural connectivity relates to visuospatial reasoning, information  processing speed and crystallized ability, but not memory, in this relatively  healthy age-homogeneous cohort of 73 year olds. When adjusted for mean FA across the  network, most relationships are lost, except with information processing speed  suggesting that the underlying topological network structure is related to this  cognitive domain. Moreover, the connectome-processing speed relationship is partly  mediated by WMH volume in this cohort.

Methods: A total of 2  296 old people aged ≥65 years old from 8 longevity areas were enrolled in our  baseline survey in 2012. The information of demographics characteristic, life style,  self-assessed health and mood or emotional state, cognitive function, abilities of  daily living and physical activity were collected by questionnaire. There were 891  SA people in total, whose SA score was 4-5. 891 SA and 1 396 non-SA participated in  the follow-up study in 2014. Finally, 860 SA and non-SA people were matched by  orientation analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore the  relationship between successful aging index and survival status. Results: After 2  years of follow-up, a total of 1 442 elderly survived, with an average baseline age  at (83.69±10.81) years old and 278 elderly people died, with an average baseline age  at (93.41±9.05) years old. The mortality rate was 16.16% (278/1 720) in total, and  it was 13.14% (113/860) in SA group, which was lower than it in non-SA group  (19.19%, 165/860), and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). The  analysis of the multivariate Cox regression showed that SA was the protective factor  of the survival of the elderly after age and sex adjusted.

Methods: This study used the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe, a 10-yr population-based cohort study with repeated measurements in five waves, every 2 yr between 2004 and 2013. Self-reported physical inactivity (waves 1, 2, 4, and 5), household income (waves 1, 2, 4, and 5), educational attainment (wave of the first measurement occasion), and early-life socioeconomic circumstance (wave 3) were collected in 22,846 individuals 50 to 95 yr of age. Results: Risk of physical inactivity was increased for women with the most disadvantaged early-life socioeconomic circumstances (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.86). With aging, the risk of physical inactivity increased for both sexes and was strongest for those with the most disadvantaged early-life socioeconomic circumstances (OR, 1.04 (95% CI, 1.02-1.06) for women; OR, 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00-1.05) for men), with the former effect being more robust than the latter one. The association between early-life socioeconomic circumstances and physical inactivity was mediated by adult-life socioeconomic circumstances, with education being the strongest mediator. Conclusions: Early-life socioeconomic circumstances predicted high levels of physical inactivity at older ages, but this effect was mediated by socioeconomic indicators in adult life. This finding has implications for public health policies, which should continue to promote education to reduce physical inactivity in people at older ages and to ensure optimal healthy aging trajectories, especially among women with disadvantaged early-life socioeconomic circumstances.","2018-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:51:36","","476-485","","3","50","","Med Sci Sports Exerc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 29112624","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Europe; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Self Report; Public Health; *Sedentary Behavior; *Socioeconomic Factors; Income; Middle Age; Repeated Measures; Physical Activity -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both proteins are present in the normal brain during aging. However,  the temporal sequence of their involvement in the onset of AD pathology remains  controversial. To define whether amyloid β protein deposits or tau protein lesions  appear first during normal brain aging, we performed an immunohistological study on  serial sections from 105 autopsy brains (age range: 40-104 years) from patients free  of clinical signs of cognitive decline, using anti-tau (AT8) and anti-amyloid (4G8)  antibodies in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex (Brodmann  area 20), prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9), occipital cortex (Brodmann areas 17  and 18), and in the brainstem. All cases older than 48 years displayed at least a  few neurofibrillary tangles, which appeared more frequently in the entorhinal than  in the transentorhinal cortex. Tau pathology in these areas preceded tau inclusions  in the brainstem. Furthermore, the first site of the apparition of tau pathology is  inconsistent, being the entorhinal cortex in most cases, and in fewer cases, the  transentorhinal region. There was no case presenting with amyloid deposition in the  absence of neurofibrillary tangles, lending evidence to the fact that  neurofibrillary tangles appear earlier than amyloid plaques during normal brain  aging. However, the role of amyloid in promoting tau deposition cannot be excluded  in some cases but may not represent the sole mechanism of disease induction and  progression.","2018-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:49:10","","34-44","","","62","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Cognitive performance was evaluated  at baseline and 8 years later in 543 participants of the PROOF cohort, initially  aged 67 years. Subjects were categorized as Cognitively Elite (CE), Cognitively  Normal (CN) or Cognitively Impaired (CI) at each evaluation. At follow-up,  demographic data and lifestyle, including social, intellectual and physical  behaviors, were collected by questionnaires. RESULTS: As much as 69% (n=375)  remained unchanged, while 25.5% (n=138) decreased and 5.5% (n=30) improved. When  present, the reduction in cognitive status was most often limited to one level, but  was dependent on the initial level, affecting up to 73% of the initially CN, but  only 58% of the initially CE. Cognitive stability was significantly associated with  the degree of social engagement at follow-up (CE: P=0.009; CN: P=0.025). CONCLUSION:  In the healthy elderly, high cognitive ability predicts both cognitive ability and  social involvement in later life. Cognitive decline by only one level may also  extend the time to reach impairment, underlining the importance of the so-called  cognitive reserve.","2017-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:40:49","","637-644","","10","173","","Rev Neurol (Paris)","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017.

However, something that has been overlooked is relation between memory functioning, determined by objective tests as well as subjective memory ratings, and subjective well-being (SWB). Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal (cross-lagged) relationships between episodic memory (both subjective and objective) and SWB. Method: A total of 586 older individuals (60-90 years) were assessed on multiple measures of the targeted constructs at baseline (Time 1) as part of the Betula cohort study. Five years later (Time 2), 354 of the participants returned for follow-up measurements and were included in cross-lagged panel analyses. Results: As expected, objective memory and subjective memory showed a pattern of cross-sectional age deficits and a mean level longitudinal decline was observed for objective memory. By contrast, SWB showed stable mean levels both across age and time. No cross-sectional or cross-lagged associations were observed between SWB and objective memory, whereas subjective memory and SWB showed a cross-sectional association. Conclusion: The results underscore that successful aging is a multifaceted construct with no or only weak associations between the investigated components. However, SWB and rate of change at the individual level should be considered to define successful aging.","2019-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:26:31","","92-99","","1","23","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 29086589","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Memory; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; *Successful aging; *longitudinal; Sweden; Aging/*psychology; *episodic memory; *cross-sectional; *Memory/physiology; *SWB; Middle Age; Memory Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Psychological Well-Being -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Single-centre, cross-sectional, observational, non-interventional, non-randomized trial at an University based women's hospital, division of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine. All participants followed a standardized, holistic battery of biopsychosocial assessments consisting of bio-functional status (BFS), bio-functional age (BFA) and additional validated psychometric questionnaires. Results: 462 non-pediatric, non-geriatric females were in the BeCS-14 cohort. The measured mean BFA was lower than the chronological age within the BeCS-14 cohort (regression coefficient 0.58) and comparable in the female LeCS-84 subcohort (regression coefficient age 0.85, communality age 76%). In detail, within the decades 35-45 years and 55-65 years the gradient of BFA increase (aging rate) was similar in both cohorts (decade 35-45 years: LeCS-84 4.08 ± 1.03 year equivalents and BeCS-14 4.78 ± 1.67 year equivalents; decade 55-65 years: LeCS-84 6.21 ± 1.29 year equivalents and BeCS-14 5.25 ± 1.18 year equivalents). Remarkably, within the LeCS-84 cohort the mean aging rate within the decade 45-55 years was significantly different from all other aging rates in both cohorts: 13.02 ± 1.05 year equivalents. However, within the BeCS-14 cohort the corresponding value was 4.83 ± 1.02 year equivalents thus indicating a continuous aging process across the adult life course. In BeCS-14, there was a significant age-related effect for cardiovascular performance and social stress exposition and younger age was associated with better cardiovascular performance while level of social stress exposition decreased in aging women. Conclusion: When comparing BeCS-14 and LeCS-84, the aging process seemed to be accelerated in women in LeCS-84 between 45 and 54 years of age. We can only speculate on the reasons, such as differences in the health care, political and social system. However, the differences observed support the use of our BFS/BFA assessment tool not only on an individual level (strengths/ resources) but also population level following EIP-AHA requirements. Yet, it remains to be developed how the assessed health strengths/resources-profile may be integrated into AHA management.","2017","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:35:48","","1002-1009","","9","21","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 29083441","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Aging; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Comparative Studies; *Healthy Aging; Healthy Aging; Psychometrics; Bern Cohort Study 2014; *Bern Cohort Study 2014; *bio-functional age; *bio-functional status; *Disability and Health (ICF); *European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing EIP-AHA; *health resources; *International Classification of Functioning; Psychometrics/*methods; Stress, Psychological; Psychometrics -- methods; bio-functional age; bio-functional status; Disability and Health (ICF); European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing EIP-AHA; health resources; International Classification of Functioning; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Regression; Functional Status; Nonexperimental Studies; Cardiovascular System Physiology; International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical functioning (ie, the ability to perform the physical tasks of  daily living) in adulthood is an important outcome to consider, as it is strongly  associated with an individual's ability to work, and future disability and  dependency. We aimed to establish whether maltreatment was associated with physical  functioning, independent of other early-life factors. SETTING: 1958 British birth  cohort. PARTICIPANTS: 8150 males and females with data on abuse and who participated  at age 50 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was poor physical functioning  at 50 years (<65 on the Short-Form 36 survey physical functioning subscale).  Secondary outcomes included mental health and self-reported health at 50 years.  RESULTS: 23% of participants reported at least one type of maltreatment; 12% were  identified with poor physical functioning. Neglect (OR(adj) 1.55, 95% CI 1.24 to  1.93), psychological abuse (OR(adj) 1.49, 1.17-1.88) and sexual abuse (OR(adj) 2.56,  1.66-3.96) were associated with poor physical functioning independent of other  maltreatments and covariates, including childhood social class, birth weight and  childhood illness. Odds of poor physical functioning increased with multiple types  of maltreatment (p(trend) <0.001); OR(adj) ranged from 1.49 (1.23-1.82) for a single  type to 2.09 (1.53-2.87) for those reporting > 3 types of maltreatment, compared  with those with none. Associations of similar magnitude were observed for mental and  self-reported health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Child neglect, psychological and sexual  abuse were associated with poor physical functioning at 50 years, with accumulating  risk for those with multiple types of maltreatment. Associations were independent of  numerous early-life factors and were comparable in magnitude to those observed for  mental health and self-rated health. Prevention or alleviation of the ill effects of  maltreatment could be an effective policy intervention to promote healthy ageing.","2017-10-27","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e017900","","10","7","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

This study  examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between depressive  symptoms and a baseline multibiomarker algorithm of biological age (BA) that  aggregates indicators of inflammatory, metabolic, cardiovascular, lung, liver, and  kidney functioning. METHOD: Data were analyzed from 2,776 men and women from the  prospective observational Health Aging and Body Composition Study, who had both  evaluable chronological age (CA) and BA. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the  Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS: A  covariate-adjusted regression model showed that BA (B = 0.03, p = .0471) but not CA  (B = -0.01, p = .7185) is associated with baseline CES-D scores. The mean baseline  BA for individuals with a CES-D ≥ 10 was 1.28 years greater than in those with a  CES-D < 10. Comparatively, there is only a 0.05-year difference in mean CA between  the two depression groups. A covariate-adjusted longitudinal model found that  baseline BA predicts CES-D score at follow-up (B = 0.04, p = .0058), whereas CA does  not (B = 0.03, p = .4125). Additionally, an older BA significantly predicted a CES-D  ≥ 10 (B = 0.02, p = .032) over a 10-year period. CONCLUSIONS: A multibiomarker index  of an older adult's BA outperformed their CA in predicting subsequent increased and  clinically significant depressive symptoms.

METHODS: Data  were from the 2005-2006 and 2010-2011 waves of the National Social Life, Health and  Aging Project (NSHAP), a national probability sample of older U.S. adults.  Autoregressive cross-lagged panel models tested linkages of women's testosterone  with their social networks. RESULTS: Consistent with recent biological theory  suggesting social modulation of hormones, a higher kin proportion in one's  egocentric (person-centered) network, arguably a stable compositional feature,  negatively predicted women's testosterone levels. In contrast, findings for tie  strength were consistent with hormonal regulation of women's sociality-with both  perceived support from friends and family, and closeness to network members,  negatively influenced by testosterone. DISCUSSION: Rather than being a static and  exogenous biological factor, older women's testosterone levels seem partly an  outcome of their social context. Implications for sexual health and hormone therapy  are discussed. However, this androgen also influences dimensions of their intimate  networks critical to successful aging. Findings suggest the need for social  scientists to engage with the neuroendocrine literature, which offers suggestions on  linkages of hormones with specific network patterns.","2019-09-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1283-1293","","7","74","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2017.

As the empirical data  regarding wisdom have grown, several measures have been used to assess an  individual's level of wisdom. However, none of these measures has been based on a  construct of wisdom with neurobiological underpinnings. We sought to develop a new  scale, the San Diego Wisdom Scale (SD-WISE), which builds upon recent gains in the  understanding of psychological and neurobiological models of the trait. Data were  collected from 524 community-dwelling adults age 25-104 years as part of a  structured multi-cohort study of adult lifespan. Participants were administered the  SD-WISE along with two existing measures of wisdom that have been shown to have good  psychometric properties. Factor analyses confirmed the hypothesized measurement  model. SD-WISE total scores were reliable, demonstrated convergent and discriminant  validity, and correlated, as hypothesized, negatively with emotional distress, but  positively with well-being. However, the magnitudes of these associations were  small, suggesting that the SD-WISE is not just a global measure of mental state. The  results support the reliability and validity of SD-WISE scores. Study limitations  are discussed. The SD-WISE, with good psychometric properties, a brief  administration time, and a measurement model that is consistent with commonly cited  content domains of wisdom based on a putative neurobiological model, may be useful  in clinical practice as well as in bio-psycho-social research, especially  investigations into the neurobiology of wisdom and experimental interventions to  enhance wisdom.","2019-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:16:38","","40-47","","","108","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies mostly relied on cross-sectional methods, precluding conclusions on the temporal relationship between pain-related social support and disability. Also, research on the behavioral and psychological processes that account for such a relationship is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the following longitudinally: (1) direct effects of social support for functional autonomy/dependence on pain-related disability, (2) mediating role of physical functioning, pain-related self-efficacy, and fear, and (3) whether pain duration and pain intensity moderate such mediating processes. A total of 168 older adults (Mage = 78.3; SDage = 8.7) participated in a 3-month prospective design, with 3 moments of measurement, with a 6-week lag between them. Participants completed the Formal Social Support for Autonomy and Dependence in Pain Inventory, the Brief Pain Inventory, the 36-SF Health Survey, behavioral tasks from the Senior Fitness Test, the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia. Moderated mediation analyses showed that formal social support for functional dependence (T1) predicted an increase in pain-related disability (T3), that was mediated by self-reported physical functioning (T2) and by pain-related self-efficacy (T2) at short to moderate pain duration and at low to moderate pain intensity, but not at higher levels. Findings emphasized that social support for functional dependence is a risk factor for pain-related disability and uncovered the ""why"" and ""when"" of this relationship. Implications for the design of social support interventions aiming at promoting older adults' healthy aging despite chronic pain are drawn.","2017-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:18:20","","1915-1924","","10","158","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28930922","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Self Efficacy; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; *Social Support; Self Report; Fear; Disability Evaluation; Fear/psychology; Disabled Persons/*psychology; Chronic Pain/*complications/*psychology/rehabilitation; Negotiating; Pain Measurement; Statistics, Nonparametric; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Support, Psychosocial; Self-Efficacy; Nonparametric Statistics; Brief Pain Inventory; Chronic Pain -- Complications; Chronic Pain -- Psychosocial Factors; Chronic Pain -- Rehabilitation; Disabled -- Psychosocial Factors; Negotiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research has primarily taken a postdictive approach by  knowing the outcome (date of death) and aligning, in retrospect, how well-being has  changed for people with documented death events. In the present study, we made use  of a predictive approach by examining whether and how levels of and changes in life  satisfaction prospectively predict mortality hazards and delineate the role of  contributing factors, including health, perceived control, and social orientation.  To do so, we applied shared parameter growth-survival models to 20-year longitudinal  data from 10,597 participants (n = 1,560 [15%] deceased; age at baseline: M = 44  years, SD = 17, range = 18-98 years) from the national German Socio-Economic Panel  Study. Our findings showed that lower levels and steeper declines of life  satisfaction each uniquely predicted higher mortality risks. Results also revealed  moderating effects of age and perceived control: Life satisfaction levels and  changes had stronger predictive effects for mortality hazards among older adults.  Perceived control was associated with lower mortality hazards; however, this effect  was diminished for those who experienced accelerated life satisfaction decline.  Variance decomposition suggests that predictive effects of life satisfaction  trajectories were partially unique (3%-6%) and partially shared with physical  health, perceived control, and social orientation (17%-19%). Our discussion focuses  on the strengths and challenges of a predictive approach to link developmental  changes (in life satisfaction) to mortality hazards, and considers implications of  our findings for healthy aging.

Clinical","","2213-1582","10.1016/j.nicl.2017.08.016","","Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment and is associated with decline in executive function (EF) and information  processing speed (IPS). Imaging biomarkers are needed that can monitor and identify  individuals at risk of severe cognitive decline. Recently there has been interest in  combining several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD into a unitary  score to describe disease severity. Here we apply a diffusion tensor image (DTI)  segmentation technique (DSEG) to describe SVD related changes in a single unitary  score across the whole cerebrum, to investigate its relationship with cognitive  change over a three-year period. 98 patients (aged 43-89) with SVD underwent annual  MRI scanning and cognitive testing for up to three years. DSEG provides a vector of  16 discrete segments describing brain microstructure of healthy and/or damaged  tissue. By calculating the scalar product of each DSEG vector in reference to that  of a healthy ageing control we generate an angular measure (DSEG θ) describing the  patients' brain tissue microstructural similarity to a disease free model of a  healthy ageing brain. Conventional MRI markers of SVD brain change were also  assessed including white matter hyperintensities, cerebral atrophy, incident  lacunes, cerebral-microbleeds, and white matter microstructural damage measured by  DTI histogram parameters. The impact of brain change on cognition was explored using  linear mixed-effects models. Post-hoc sample size analysis was used to assess the  viability of DSEG θ as a tool for clinical trials. Changes in brain structure  described by DSEG θ were related to change in EF and IPS (p < 0.001) and remained  significant in multivariate models including other MRI markers of SVD as well as  age, gender and premorbid IQ. Of the conventional markers, presence of new lacunes  was the only marker to remain a significant predictor of change in EF and IPS in the  multivariate models (p = 0.002). Change in DSEG θ was also related to change in all  other MRI markers (p < 0.017), suggesting it may be used as a surrogate marker of  SVD damage across the cerebrum. Sample size estimates indicated that fewer patients  would be required to detect treatment effects using DSEG θ compared to conventional  MRI and DTI markers of SVD severity. DSEG θ is a powerful tool for characterising  subtle brain change in SVD that has a negative impact on cognition and remains a  significant predictor of cognitive change when other MRI markers of brain change are  accounted for. DSEG provides an automatic segmentation of the whole cerebrum that is  sensitive to a range of SVD related structural changes and successfully predicts  cognitive change. Power analysis shows DSEG θ has potential as a monitoring tool in  clinical trials. As such it may provide a marker of SVD severity from a single  imaging modality (i.e. DTIs).","2017","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","330-342","","","16","","Neuroimage Clin","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28861335  PMCID: PMC5568143","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Aging/*physiology; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods; Executive Function/*physiology; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases/*diagnostic imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods; Biomarker; Cerebral small vessel disease; Cerebrum/*diagnostic imaging; Cognitive decline; Cognitive Dysfunction/*physiopathology; Diffusion segmentation; Diffusion tensor imaging; DSEG, diffusion tensor image segmentation algorithm; EF, executive functions; IPS, information processing speed; SVD, cerebral small vessel disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor aging expectations can  contribute to this lack of activity, since negative stereotypes about the aging  process can be internalized and affect physical performance. Although prior  cross-sectional studies have shown that physical activity and aging expectations are  associated, less is known about this association longitudinally, particularly among  traditionally underrepresented groups. It is also unclear whether different domains  of aging expectations are differentially associated with physical activity. DESIGN  AND METHODS: The number of minutes/week of physical activity in which Baltimore  Experience Corps Trial participants (N = 446; 92.6% African American) engaged were  measured using the CHAMPS questionnaire, while their aging expectations were  measured using the ERA-12 survey. Linear mixed effects models assessed the  association between physical activity and aging expectations over 2 years, both in  full and sex-stratified samples. Separate models were also fit for different ERA-12  domains. RESULTS: We found that higher overall expectations regarding aging are  associated with higher engagement in moderate- to high-intensity physical activity  over a 2-year period of time for women only. When the ERA-12 domains were examined  separately, only the physical domain was associated with physical activity, both in  women and overall. IMPLICATIONS: Low expectations regarding physical aging may  represent a barrier to physical activity for older adults. Given that most older  adults do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines, identifying factors  that improve aging expectations may be a way to increase physical activity levels in  aging populations.","2017-08-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","S178-S186","","suppl_2","57","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2017.

However, limited work has investigated the distribution of FCH in older age or considered the antecedents of FCH. Based on prior work linking psychological well-being with cardiovascular endpoints, higher psychological well-being was hypothesized to be associated with increased likelihood of maintaining FCH over time.Methods: Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The first study wave (2002-2003) included men and women aged ≥50 years. The analytic sample (N=4,925) was restricted to individuals without baseline cardiovascular disease and with clinical data from three follow-ups through 2013. Psychological well-being was assessed with 17 items from the Control, Autonomy, Satisfaction, and Pleasure scale. FCH was defined as being a non-smoker, diabetes-free, and having healthy levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI (FCH scores ranged from 0-5). Statistical analyses conducted in 2016-2017 used linear mixed models to examine associations between psychological well-being and FCH scores over time. Secondary analyses examined cardiovascular-related mortality.Results: Only 1% of participants had achieved complete FCH at study baseline. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors and depression, greater psychological well-being was associated with higher FCH scores across time (β=0.05, 95% CI=0.02, 0.08), but not rate of change in FCH. Psychological well-being was also associated with a 29% reduced risk of cardiovascular-related mortality in multivariable-adjusted models.Conclusions: Findings suggest that psychological well-being is associated with having FCH at older ages, and add to knowledge of assets that may increase likelihood of healthy aging.","2017-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:10:58","","791-798","","6","53","","Am J Prev Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

METHODS AND  RESULTS: Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured twice using  applanation tonometry at mean ages 65 (in 2008/2009) and 70 (in 2012/2013) years in  the Whitehall-II study (N=5196). Physical activity was self-reported at PWV baseline  (2008/2009) and twice before (in 1997/1999 and 2002/2003). Sedentary time was  defined as sitting time watching television or at work/commute. Linear mixed models  adjusted for metabolic and lifestyle risk factors were used to analyze PWV change.  Mean (SD) PWV (m/s) was 8.4 (2.4) at baseline and 9.2 (2.7) at follow-up,  representing a 5-year increase of 0.76 m/s (95% CI 0.69, 0.83). A smaller 5-year  increase in PWV was observed for each additional hour/week spent in sports activity  (-0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.03, -0.001]) or cycling (-0.02 m/s [-0.03, -0.008]). Walking,  housework, gardening, or do-it-yourself activities were not significantly associated  with aortic stiffening. Each additional hour/week spent sitting was associated with  faster PWV progression in models adjusted for physical activity (0.007 m/s [95% CI  0.001, 0.013]). Increasing physical activity over time was associated with a smaller  subsequent increase in PWV (-0.16 m/s [-0.32, -0.002]) compared with not changing  activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical  activity and avoidance of sedentary behavior were each associated with a slower  age-related progression of aortic stiffness independent of conventional vascular  risk factors.","2017-08-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","","","8","6","","J Am Heart Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 The Authors.

Postoperative delirium severity and occurrence were assessed during the hospital stay using the Confusion Assessment Method and a validated chart review method. We investigated the association of delirium severity and occurrence with longitudinal diffusion changes across 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, vascular comorbidity, and baseline cognitive performance. We also assessed the association between changes in diffusion and cognitive performance across the 1-year follow-up period, adjusting for age, sex, education, and baseline cognitive performance.Results: Postoperative delirium occurred in 25 participants (22%). Delirium severity and occurrence were associated with longitudinal diffusion changes in the periventricular, frontal, and temporal white matter. Diffusion changes were also associated with changes in cognitive performance across 1 year, although the cognitive changes did not show significant association with delirium severity or occurrence.Conclusions: Our study raises the possibility that delirium has an effect on the development of brain microstructural abnormalities, which may reflect brain changes underlying cognitive trajectories. Future studies are warranted to clarify whether delirium is the driving factor of the observed changes or rather a correlate of a vulnerable brain that is at high risk for neurodegenerative processes.","2017-09-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:38:53","","1020-1027","","10","89","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 American Academy of Neurology.","","","","","","PMID: 28779010  PMCID: PMC5589796","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Funding Source; Human; Brain; Disease Progression; Severity of Illness Index; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; *Diffusion Tensor Imaging; *Elective Surgical Procedures; Delirium/*drug therapy/*etiology; Postoperative Complications/*diagnostic imaging; Severity of Illness Indices; Surgery, Elective; Delirium -- Etiology; Delirium -- Drug Therapy; Postoperative Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the determinants of InVa remain unclear. Methods The present study included 4756 adults aged 55 years and older who completed the baseline examination of the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan. During the examination, each participant received assessments of InVa status. Comprehensive assessments of sociodemographic (age, sex, education level, marital status, living alone and occupation) and health-related factors (chronic diseases, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activities, cognitive status and physical performance) were also carried out. The InVa rate was defined as the number of participants who reported receiving free InVa divided by the total number of candidates for free InVa. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the sociodemographic and health-related determinants of InVa status. Results The coverage rate of InVa was 44.8% (2130/4756). Older age (adjusted odds ratio [OR; >75 years vs <65 years] 7.72, 95% CI 6.26-9.52), multiple chronic diseases (OR [≥2 vs 0)] 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.65) and physical activity (OR [yes vs no] 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.64) were positively associated with receiving InVa. A current smoking status (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.82) was negatively associated with receiving InVa. Conclusions Older adults who received InVa differed from non-receivers in multiple sociodemographic and health-related characteristics.

METHODS: We analyzed the 1989 (baseline), and 2003 and 2007  (end-point) datasets of the Taiwan Longitudinal Survey on Aging, a national cohort  study. A total of 1977 participants aged 62-69 years at baseline were tracked for  14-18 years. The outcome measure was ""being healthy octogenarians"", defined as  participants who were aged ≥80 years, free from activities of daily living  dependency, depressive symptoms or cognitive impairment, and able to provide social  support. A logistic regression model was used to identify the predictors. RESULTS:  The results showed that higher educational level, conjugal living, absence of  smoking or betel quid chewing, moderate alcohol drinking, routine physical activity,  more leisure activities, no hypertension, no diabetes, sleeping well and satisfied  with economic condition were the positive predictors for becoming a healthy  octogenarian. CONCLUSIONS: Using a multidimensional criterion, the present study  identified a list of factors in predicting older Taiwanese becoming healthy  octogenarians. The findings highlight the need to identify potential factors for  various populations. Many of the predictors are modifiable factors.

We  expected this within-person coupling to differ between persons as a function of  self-perceived global cognitive decline and depression, anxiety, or neuroticism.  METHODS: This was an intensive measurement (short-term longitudinal) study of 29  older adult volunteers between the ages of 65 and 80 years without an existing  diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Baseline assessment included  neuropsychological testing and self-reported depression, anxiety, and neuroticism,  as well as self- and informant-reported cognitive decline (relative to 10 years  previously). Intensive within-person measurement occasions included subjective  ratings of cognitive function paired with performance on a computerized working  memory (n-back) task; each participant attended four or five assessments separated  by intervals of at least one day. Statistical analysis was comprised of multilevel  linear regression. RESULTS: Comparison of models suggested that both neuroticism and  self-rated cognitive decline explained unique variance in the within-person,  across-occasion coupling of subjective cognitive function with objective working  memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Self-ratings of cognition may accurately reflect  day-to-day variations in objective cognitive performance among older adults,  especially for individuals lower in neuroticism and higher in self-reported  cognitive decline. Clinicians should consider these individual differences when  determining the validity of complaints about perceived cognitive declines in the  context of otherwise healthy aging.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of  weight gain from early to middle adulthood with health outcomes later in life.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort analysis of US women from the Nurses'  Health Study (1976-June 30, 2012) and US men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up  Study (1986-January 31, 2012) who recalled weight during early adulthood (at age of  18 years in women; 21 years in men), and reported current weight during middle  adulthood (at age of 55 years). EXPOSURES: Weight change from early to middle  adulthood (age of 18 or 21 years to age of 55 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  Beginning at the age of 55 years, participants were followed up to the incident  disease outcomes. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and death were confirmed by  medical records or the National Death Index. A composite healthy aging outcome was  defined as being free of 11 chronic diseases and major cognitive or physical  impairment.

For type 2 diabetes, the  adjusted incidence per 100 000 person-years was 207 among women who gained a  moderate amount of weight (≥2.5 kg to <10 kg) vs 110 among women who maintained a  stable weight (weight loss ≤2.5 kg or gain <2.5 kg) (absolute rate difference [ARD]  per 100 000 person-years, 98; 95% CI, 72 to 127) and 258 vs 147, respectively, among  men (ARD, 111; 95% CI, 58 to 179); hypertension: 3415 vs 2754 among women (ARD, 662;  95% CI, 545 to 782) and 2861 vs 2366 among men (ARD, 495; 95% CI, 281 to 726);  cardiovascular disease: 309 vs 248 among women (ARD, 61; 95% CI, 38 to 87) and 383  vs 340 among men (ARD, 43; 95% CI, -14 to 109); obesity-related cancer: 452 vs 415  among women (ARD, 37; 95% CI, 4 to 73) and 208 vs 165 among men (ARD, 42; 95% CI,  0.5 to 94). Among those who gained a moderate amount of weight, 3651 women (24%) and  2405 men (37%) achieved the composite healthy aging outcome. Among those who  maintained a stable weight, 1528 women (27%) and 989 men (39%) achieved the  composite healthy aging outcome. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for the  composite healthy aging outcome associated with moderate weight gain was 0.78 (95%  CI, 0.72 to 0.84) in women and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.97) in men. Higher amounts of  weight gain were associated with greater risks of major chronic diseases and lower  likelihood of healthy aging. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In these cohorts of health  professionals, weight gain during adulthood was associated with significantly  increased risk of major chronic diseases and decreased odds of healthy aging. These  findings may help counsel patients regarding the risks of weight gain.","2017-07-18","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","255-269","","3","318","","JAMA","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28719691  PMCID: PMC5817436","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Adolescent; Follow-Up Studies; Incidence; Mortality; Multivariate Analysis; Young Adult; Obesity/*complications; Chronic Disease/*epidemiology; *Weight Gain; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/etiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/etiology; Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationships between brain  networks and cognition during aging in later life are moderated by demographic and  environmental factors, such as prior education, in a poorly understood manner. Using  multivariate analyses, we identified three latent patterns (or modes) linking  resting-state functional connectivity to demographic and cognitive measures in 101  cognitively normal elders. The first mode (P = 0.00043) captures an opposing  association between age and core cognitive processes such as attention and  processing speed on functional connectivity patterns. The functional subnetwork  expressed by this mode links bilateral sensorimotor and visual regions through key  areas such as the parietal operculum. A strong, independent association between  years of education and functional connectivity loads onto a second mode (P = 0.012),  characterized by the involvement of key hub regions. A third mode (P = 0.041)  captures weak, residual brain-behavior relations. Our findings suggest that circuits  supporting lower level cognitive processes are most sensitive to the influence of  age in healthy older adults.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Uppsala  Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Swedish men (n = 1,104) at a  mean age of 71 (range 69.4-74.1) were investigated, 369 of whom were evaluated for  independent aging 16 years later, at a mean age of 87 (range 84.8-88.9).  MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire was used to obtain information on lifestyle, including  education, living conditions, and physical activity. Adherence to a  Mediterranean-like diet was assessed according to a modified Mediterranean Diet  Score derived from 7-day food records. Cardiovascular risk factors were measured.  Independent aging at a mean age of 87 was defined as lack of diagnosed dementia, a  Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or greater, not institutionalized,  independence in personal activities of daily living, and ability to walk outdoors  alone. Complete survival data at age 85 were obtained from the Swedish Cause of  Death Register. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent of the men survived to age 85, and 75%  of the participants at a mean age of 87 displayed independent aging. Independent  aging was associated with never smoking (vs current) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95%  confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-4.60) and high (vs low) adherence to a  Mediterranean-like diet (OR = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.14-6.80). Normal weight or overweight  and waist circumference of 102 cm or less were also associated with independent  aging. Similar associations were observed with survival.

From an evolutionary perspective, the ultimate cause may be rooted in  ancestral parenting and grandparenting. These activities may have generalized to a  neural and hormonal caregiving system that also enabled prosocial behavior beyond  the family. From a psychological perspective, helping others may be associated with  healthy aging, which, in turn, contributes to longevity as a proximate cause. Yet  little is known about the extent to which mediating factors such as the health  benefits of helping behaviors translate into enhanced longevity, particularly in  regard to grandparenting. To fill this gap, we conducted mediation analyses  (structural equation models) to examine whether grandparenting and supporting others  in the social network contributed directly or indirectly (through better health 5-6  years later) to the longevity of older helpers. We drew on longitudinal data from  the Berlin Aging Study (N = 516), in which older adults in Berlin, Germany, were  interviewed at baseline (1990-1993, mean age at entry = 85 years) and continuously  followed up until 2009. Results suggest that the associations of both grandparenting  and supporting others with enhanced longevity are mediated by better prospective  health (indirect effect). The effect of helping was not fully mediated,  however-helping was also directly associated with increased longevity independently  of the health indicators measured. The results were robust against effects of the  helper's preexisting health status and sociodemographic characteristics of  participants, their children, and grandchildren. We conclude that better prospective  health contributes to the link between helping and longevity, but does not fully  account for it. Other potential contributing mechanisms remain to be identified. As  populations age across the globe, identifying mechanisms that foster health in old  age can help to highlight potential targets for public health interventions.","2017-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","109-117","","","187","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Twenty-three older adults (aged 61 to 80 years) completed a 6-month  supervised RT intervention applying progressive introduction of higher effort set  end points. After completion of the intervention participants could choose to  continue performing RT unsupervised until 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Strength, body  composition, function, and wellbeing all significantly improved over the  intervention. Over the follow-up, body composition changes reverted to baseline  values, strength was reduced though it remained significantly higher than baseline,  and wellbeing outcomes were mostly maintained. Comparisons over the follow-up  between those who did and those who did not continue with RT revealed no significant  differences for changes in any outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Supervised RT employing  progressive application of high effort set end points is well tolerated and  effective in improving strength, body composition, function, and wellbeing in older  adults. However, whether participants continued, or did not, with RT unsupervised at  follow-up had no effect on outcomes perhaps due to reduced effort employed during  unsupervised RT.","2017","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2541090","","","2017","","Biomed Res Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28676855  PMCID: PMC5476889","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Muscle Strength/*physiology; Exercise/*physiology; Healthy Aging/*physiology; Body Composition/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In 274 members of the PREVENT-AD cohort of  healthy aging persons with a parental or multiple-sibling history of AD dementia, we  assessed the cross-sectional association of OI with potential indicators of  presymptomatic AD. Some 101 participants donated CSF, thus enabling assessment of AD  pathology with the biomarkers total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (P(181)-tau), and their  ratios with β-amyloid (Aβ(1-42)). Adjusted analyses considered age, cognition, APOE  ε4 status, education, and sex as covariates. We measured OI using the University of  Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and cognitive performance using the  Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Standard kits  provided assays of the AD biomarkers. Analyses used robust-fit linear regression  models. RESULTS: Reduced OI was associated with lower cognitive score and older age,  as well as increased ratios of CSF t-tau and P(181)-tau to Aβ(1-42) (all p < 0.02).  However, the observed associations of OI with age and cognition were unapparent in  adjusted models that restricted observations to CSF donors and included AD  biomarkers. OI showed little association with CSF Aβ(1-42) alone except in APOE ε4  carriers having lowest-quartile Aβ(1-42) levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings from  healthy high-risk older individuals suggest that OI reflects degree of preclinical  AD pathology, while its relationships with age and cognition result from the  association of these latter variables with such pathology. Diminished OI may be a  practical and affordable biomarker of AD pathology.","2017-07-25","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:24:58","","327-335","","4","89","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Method: One hundred and seventy older adults (Mage = 78.0; SD = 8.7) with chronic musculoskeletal pain participated in a 3-month prospective study, with 3 measurement moments. Participants filled out the Formal Social Support for Autonomy and Dependence in Pain Inventory, the Portuguese versions of the Brief Pain Inventory, the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. Results: Using structural equation modeling, it was found that perceived promotion of autonomy, at Time 1, moderated the relationship between pain intensity (T1) and pain-related disability (T2); this moderation was fully mediated by pain-related self-efficacy (T2). Perceived promotion of dependence was not a significant moderator. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of social support for functional autonomy in buffering the impact of pain intensity on older adults' pain-related disability.

One possible explanation is that MW is a resource-dependent  process, and cognitive resources decline with age. The present study provides the  first investigation of MW in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to  further examine the resource model and discontinuities between healthy aging and AD.  METHOD: Three large cohorts completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task  (SART): a healthy middle-aged group (mean age = 61.79 ± 5.84 years; N = 270), a  healthy older adult group (mean age = 76.58 ± 5.27 years; N = 282), and a group with  early stage AD (mean age = 76.08 ± 7.17; N = 77), comparable in age to the second  group. RESULTS: Self-reports of MW during the SART decreased as a function of age,  and there was a further decrease in the AD group. All 3 groups produced faster  responses on trials before No-Go errors, suggesting MW occurred in all cohorts.  After No-Go errors, healthy older adults slowed disproportionately compared with  middle-aged adults. This was not evident in AD individuals who showed posterror  slowing comparable with that in the middle-aged group. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased  self-reported MW in older adults and the further decline in AD are consistent with  the cognitive resource account of MW. Behavioral indices suggest that AD is on a  continuum with healthy aging, with the exception of posterror slowing that may  suggest performance monitoring deficits in early AD individuals (e.g., lack of error  awareness).

Understanding longitudinal alterations to white matter may provide new insights into  trajectories of brain change in both healthy aging and AD, and fluid biomarkers may  be particularly useful in this effort. To examine this, 151 late-middle-aged  participants enriched with risk for AD with at least one lumbar puncture and two  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans were selected for analysis from two large  observational and longitudinally followed cohorts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was  assayed for biomarkers of AD-specific pathology (phosphorylated-tau/Aβ42 ratio),  axonal degeneration (neurofilament light chain protein, NFL), dendritic degeneration  (neurogranin), and inflammation (chitinase-3-like protein 1, YKL-40). Linear mixed  effects models were performed to test the hypothesis that biomarkers for AD,  neurodegeneration, and inflammation, or two-year change in those biomarkers, would  be associated with worse white matter health overall and/or progressively worsening  white matter health over time. At baseline in the cingulum, phosphorylated-tau/Aβ42  was associated with higher mean diffusivity (MD) overall (intercept) and YKL-40 was  associated with increases in MD over time. Two-year change in neurogranin was  associated with higher mean diffusivity and lower fractional anisotropy overall  (intercepts) across white matter in the entire brain and in the cingulum. These  findings suggest that biomarkers for AD, neurodegeneration, and inflammation are  potentially important indicators of declining white matter health in a cognitively  healthy, late-middle-aged cohort.","2019-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:51:58","","41-52","","1","13","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28600739  PMCID: PMC5723250","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers; Apolipoproteins; Brain; Longitudinal; Disease Progression; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid; Apolipoprotein E4/genetics; Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnostic imaging/genetics; Cerebrospinal fluid; Linear mixed effects; Nerve Degeneration/diagnostic imaging; Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease; White matter; White Matter/*diagnostic imaging; Nerve Degeneration; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease -- Cerebrospinal Fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impaired postural stability is a potential risk factor related to falls,  although the evidence is inconclusive, partly due to the lack of prospective  studies. This study aimed to investigate how objective measures of postural sway  predict incident falls. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: this prospectively  observational study included 1,877 community-dwelling individuals aged 70 years who  participated in the Healthy Ageing Initiative between June 2012 and December 2015.  MEASUREMENTS: postural sway was measured during eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC)  trials using the Wii Balance Board. Functional mobility, muscle strength, objective  physical activity and cognitive performance were also measured. Participants  reported incident falls 6 and 12 months after the examination. RESULTS: during  follow-up, 255 (14%) prospective fallers were identified. Division of centre of  pressure (COP) sway lengths into quintiles revealed a nonlinear distribution of  falls for EO trial data, but not EC trial data. After adjustment for multiple  confounders, fall risk was increased by 75% for participants with COP sway lengths  ≥400 mm during the EO trial (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.09-2.79), and approximately doubled for sway lengths ≥920 mm during the EC trial  (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.12-3.22). CONCLUSION: objective measures of postural sway  independently predict incident falls in older community-dwelling men and women.  Further studies are needed to evaluate whether postural sway length is of interest  for the prediction of incident falls in clinical settings.","2017-11-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:50:49","","964-970","","6","46","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2017.

Recently, a more even mealtime distribution of dietary protein was positively associated with  muscle mass, but the relation of this distribution to physical performance remains  unknown.Objective: We examined the relation between mealtime protein-intake  distribution and physical performance and its 3-y decline in community-dwelling  older adults.Design: Three-year follow-up data from 827 men and 914 women (67-84 y)  in the longitudinal study on nutrition and aging [Quebec longitudinal study on  Nutrition as a Determinant of Successful Aging (NuAge study); Quebec, Canada] were  analyzed. Physical performance, which was measured yearly, was grouped into the  following 2 functional composite scores: muscle strength (handgrip, arm, and leg)  and mobility (timed-up-and-go, chair stand, and walking speed). Dietary data were  collected in 2 sets of three 24-h food recalls at baseline and year 2. The  individual mealtime protein distribution was calculated as the CV (i.e., SD divided  by the mean) of grams of protein per meal. A mixed model analysis was used to  examine trajectories of muscle strength and mobility across time by sex as  conditioned by the protein distribution and adjusted for potential  covariates.Results: Physical performance deteriorated over 3 y with muscle strength  declining more than the mobility score in men (-1.51 ± 1.68 compared with -0.66 ±  2.81) and women (-1.35 ± 1.77 compared with -0.78 ± 2.63) (means ± SD, P < 0.001).  More-evenly distributed protein intake, independent of the total quantity, was  associated with a higher muscle-strength score in both sexes throughout follow-up.  It was also associated with a greater mobility score, but only in men and only  before adjustment for covariates. Strength and mobility rates of decline were not  affected by protein-intake distribution in either sex.Conclusions: In addition to  the previously observed association with lean mass, an even distribution of daily  protein intake across meals is independently associated with greater muscle  strength, but not with the mobility score, in older adults. A longer-term  investigation of the role of protein intake and its distribution on physical  performance is warranted, as are intervention studies, to support future  recommendations.","2017-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:55:47","","113-124","","1","106","","Am J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2017 American Society for Nutrition.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 28515070","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; P-Value; aging; *Aging; *Diet; Hand Strength; physical performance; *Feeding Behavior; diet; nutrition; *Physical Fitness; Movement; Quebec; *Meals; dietary protein; Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology; dynapenia; functional capacity; Gait; mobility; Muscle Strength/*drug effects; skewed protein intake; Food Intake -- In Old Age; Community Living -- In Old Age; Nutritional Assessment -- In Old Age; Dietary Proteins -- In Old Age; Muscle Strength -- In Old Age; Eating Behavior -- In Old Age; Physical Mobility -- In Old Age; Physical Performance -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: HA was assessed in 2007  to 2009 among 2,733 individuals, aged 45 to 60 years and free of diabetes,  cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline (1994-1995). HA was defined as not  developing any major chronic disease, good physical and cognitive functioning, no  limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no depressive symptoms, no  health-related limitations in social life, good overall self-perceived health, and  no function-limiting pain. Associations between anthropometric indicators (measured  in 1995-1996) and HA were assessed using robust-error-variance Poisson regression.  RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, BMI (continuous) was negatively  associated with HA: relative risk (RR) = 0.97 (95% confidence interval = 0.96-0.99).  Moreover, the detrimental role of obesity (RR(obesity vs. normal weight)  = 0.67  [0.51-0.88]) was substantially stronger than that of overweight (RR(overweight vs.  normal weight)  = 0.91 [0.81-1.01]).

Decline in fluid intelligence, one of the most debilitating aspects of cognitive  aging, has been linked to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status; however,  it is not known whether this phenomenon results from specific omega-3 PUFAs acting  on particular aspects of brain health. Therefore, this study aims to explore whether  particular patterns of omega-3 PUFAs influence fluid intelligence by supporting  specific neural structures. METHODS: We measured six plasma phospholipid omega-3  PUFAs, fluid intelligence, and regional gray matter volume in the frontal and  parietal cortices in 100 cognitively intact older adults (65-75 years old). A  four-step mediation analysis was implemented using principal component analysis and  multivariate linear regressions, adjusted for age, gender, education, and body mass  index. RESULTS: The mediation analysis revealed that one pattern of omega-3 PUFAs,  consisting of alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and eicosatrienoic acid, was  linked to fluid intelligence, and that total gray matter volume of the left  frontoparietal cortex (FPC) fully mediated the relationship between this omega-3  PUFA pattern and fluid intelligence. DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate that fluid  intelligence may be optimally supported by specific omega-3 PUFAs through  preservation of FPC gray matter structure in cognitively intact older adults. This  report provides novel evidence for the benefits of particular omega-3 PUFA patterns  on fluid intelligence and underlying gray matter structure.","2018-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:38:38","","570-579","","8","21","","Nutr Neurosci","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 28492102","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutritional Status; Cohort Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurons -- pathology; Biomarkers; Biomarkers -- blood; Frontal Lobe -- metabolism; Frontal Lobe -- pathology; Parietal Lobe -- metabolism; Parietal Lobe -- pathology; Neuroimaging; Biomarkers/blood; *Nutritional Status; *Cognitive Aging; Cognitive Aging; Patient Compliance; Principal Component Analysis; *Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Brain aging; Cognitive aging; Cognitive performance; Cortical integrity; Diet, Healthy; Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*administration & dosage/blood; Frontal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/pathology; Healthy Aging/blood/*metabolism/pathology; Illinois; Neurons/*metabolism/pathology; Neuroprotection; Nutrient biomarker patterns; Nutrient biomarkers; Nutritional cognitive neuroscience; Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/pathology; Healthy Aging -- metabolism; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Fatty Acids, Omega-3 -- blood; Healthy Aging -- blood; Healthy Aging -- pathology; Frontal Lobe -- diagnostic imaging; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Fatty Acids, Omega-3 -- administration & dosage; Neurons -- metabolism; Parietal Lobe -- diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To develop prediction models  identifying both risk factors and protective factors for functional deterioration,  institutionalization, and death. DESIGN: Cohort study using data from the Medicare  Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). SETTING: Community survey. PARTICIPANTS: This  study included 21,264 Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older who  participated in the MCBS from the 2001-2008 entry panels and were followed up for 2  years. METHODS: The index was derived in 60% and validated in the remaining 40%. β  Coefficients from a multinomial logistic regression model were used to derive  points, which were added together to create scores associated with the outcome. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome was activity of daily living (ADL) stage transitions  over 2 years following entry into the MCBS. Beneficiaries were categorized into 1 of  4 outcome categories: stable or improved function, functional deterioration,  institutionalization, or death. RESULTS: Our model identified 16 factors for  functional deterioration (age, gender, education, living arrangement, dual  eligibility, proxy use, Alzheimer disease/dementia, angina pectoris/coronary heart  disease, diabetes, emphysema/asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  mental/psychiatric disorder, Parkinson disease, stroke/brain hemorrhage, hearing  impairment, vision impairment, and baseline ADL stage) after backward selection (P <  .05). Compared to stable or improved function, the risk of functional deterioration  ranged from ≤1 to ≥6, ≤4 to ≥22 for the risk of institutionalization, and ≤3 to ≥16  for the risk of death. CONCLUSION: Predictive indices, or point and scoring systems  used to predict outcomes, can identify elderly Medicare beneficiaries at risk for  functional deterioration, institutionalization, and death and can aid policy makers,  clinicians, and family members in improving care for older adults and supporting  successful aging in the community.

Four hundred two adults in South Korea  responded to survey questions designed to capture the above constructs. We found  that physically active leisure participation leads to subjective well-being for both  middle-aged men and women. However, men and women exercised for different reasons.  Women exercised for the sake of their physical appearance and mental and emotional  functioning, whereas men exercised for the sake of their social desirability and  vulnerability to disease and aging.

We examined associations of perceived discrimination  measures with changes in kidney function in a prospective cohort study, the Healthy  Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span. METHODS: Our study  included 1620 participants with preserved baseline kidney function (estimated  glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m) (662 whites and 958 African  Americans, aged 30-64 years). Self-reported perceived racial discrimination and  perceived gender discrimination (PGD) and a general measure of experience of  discrimination (EOD) (""medium versus low,"" ""high versus low"") were examined in  relation to baseline, follow-up, and annual rate of change in eGFR using multiple  mixed-effects regression (γbase, γrate) and ordinary least square models (γfollow).  RESULTS: Perceived gender discrimination ""high versus low PGD"" was associated with a  lower baseline eGFR in all models (γbase = -3.51 (1.34), p = .009 for total sample).  Among white women, high EOD was associated with lower baseline eGFR, an effect that  was strengthened in the full model (γbase = -5.86 [2.52], p = .020). Overall, ""high  versus low"" PGD was associated with lower follow-up eGFR (γfollow = -3.03 [1.45], p  = .036). Among African American women, both perceived racial discrimination and PGD  were linked to lower follow-up kidney function, an effect that was attenuated with  covariate adjustment, indicating mediation through health-related, psychosocial, and  lifestyle factors. In contrast, EOD was not linked to follow-up eGFR in any of the  sex by race groups. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived racial and gender discrimination are  associated with lower kidney function assessed by glomerular filtration rate and the  strength of associations differ by sex and race groups.

METHODS: Subjects were from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of  Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, a 20-year prospective health  disparities study with African American and white adults from Baltimore, Maryland.  All study participants completed two dietary recalls and a dietary supplement (DS)  questionnaire in Wave 3 (n = 2140). Diet quality was evaluated by the Healthy Eating  Index-2010 and the Mean Adequacy Ratio for 17 micronutrients. A comparison of  reported motivations to efficacy reported in the literature of single BS was  conducted. RESULTS: Approximately 50% (1062/2140) of participants took DS. Of these,  8% (n = 178) reported taking either BS or BDS. It was found that BDS users had  better diet quality than DS users as well as nonusers of DS. The top three  motivations for BDS users were to improve overall health, to maintain health, and to  supplement the diet. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of most BS. Review  of the efficacy of the 15 BS reported by ≥5% of the study population revealed  beneficial health roles for only fiber, gingko biloba extract EGb 761, and hawthorn  berry. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report a  better quality diet with BDS use for a racially diverse urban population. Yet,  improvement in diet is needed because overall quality did not achieve current  recommendations. To improve overall health, it may be beneficial for this population  to focus on dietary modifications to reduce the risks associated with chronic  diseases.

As various potential threats to LS tend to increase with advancing years, patterns of age-related changes in LS among older adults remain inconsistent. This study aimed to identify LS trajectories in older adults and the characteristics of individuals who experience them.Methods: Large-scale, nationally representative, longitudinal data collected from 2005 to 2013 were analyzed for this study. The outcome measure was a summary of multidimensional domains influencing LS: health, finance, housing, neighbor relationships, and family relationships. Latent class growth models and logistic regression models were used to identify trajectory groups and their predictors, respectively.Results: Within 3517 individuals aged 65 or older, five trajectories were identified across eight follow-up years: ""low-stable"" (TG1; n = 282; 8%), ""middle-stable"" (TG2; n = 1146; 32.6%), ""improving"" (TG3; n = 75; 2.1%), ""upper middle-stable"" (TG4; n = 1653; 47%), and ""high"" (TG5; n = 361; 10.3%). High trajectory individuals more frequently had higher education, financial security, good physical health, and good mental health than those in the stable, but less satisfied, groups. Similarly, compared to the largest group (upper middle-stable trajectory), individuals in the low-stable or middle-stable trajectory group not only had poorer physical and mental health but were more likely to be living alone, financially stressed, and residing in urban locations. Individuals with improving trajectory were younger and in poorer mental health at baseline compared to the upper middle-stable trajectory group.Conclusion: Life satisfaction in the older follows distinct trajectories. For older adults, trajectories are stable over time and predictable, in part, from individual characteristics. Knowledge of these patterns is important for effective policy and program development.","2017-04-19","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:24:59","","89","","1","17","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28420335  PMCID: PMC5395837","","","","Aged; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Forecasting; Longitudinal Studies; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Prospective Studies; Personal Satisfaction; Family Relations; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Republic of Korea/epidemiology; *Interpersonal Relations; Aging/*psychology; *Longitudinal study; *Personal Satisfaction; *Well-being; *Korean Retirement and Income Study (KReIS); *Latent class growth model; Mental Health/*trends; South Korea; Outcome Assessment; Mental Health -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome these limitations and provide a more stringent estimate of effects, the  current study investigated the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on aging using  newly developed epigenetic methods to assess rate of biological aging and marginal  structural modeling (MSM) to account for potential confounds due to neighborhood  selection. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that neighborhood disadvantage  accelerates aging using U.S. census data and five waves of interview data from a  sample of 100 middle-aged African American women. Using a recently developed  epigenetic index of aging, biological age was measured using weighted methylation  values at 71 CpG sites. We calculated a measure of accelerated methylomic aging (in  years) based upon the residual scores resulting from a regression of methylomic age  on chronological age. RESULTS: Controlling for a variety of individual difference  factors that could be confounded with neighborhood effects, including various health  behaviors, neighborhood disadvantage was associated with accelerated biological  aging. Using MSM to account for selection effects, a standard deviation increase in  neighborhood disadvantage accelerated aging an average of 9 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings converge with prior work to provide strong evidence that neighborhood  context is a significant determinant of healthy aging.","2019-09-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e50-e59","","7","74","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2017.

Risk factors for such cognitive  decline are unknown. METHODS: We studied 126 older participants without delirium or  dementia upon entering the Successful AGing After Elective Surgery (SAGES) study,  who developed postoperative delirium and completed repeated cognitive assessments  (up to 36 months of follow-up). Pre-surgical factors were assessed preoperatively  and divided into nine groupings of related factors (""domains""). Delirium was  evaluated at baseline and daily during hospitalization using the Confusion  Assessment Method diagnostic algorithm, and cognitive function was assessed using a  neuropsychological battery and the Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in  the Elderly (IQCODE) at baseline and 6-month intervals over 3 years. Linear  regression was used to examine associations between potential risk factors and rate  of long-term cognitive decline over time. A domain-specific and then overall  selection method based on adjusted R2 values was used to identify explanatory  factors for the outcome. RESULTS: The General Cognitive Performance (GCP) score  (combining all neuropsychological test scores), IQCODE score, and living alone were  significantly associated with long-term cognitive decline. GCP score explained the  most variation in rate of cognitive decline (13%), and six additional factors-IQCODE  score, cognitive independent activities of daily living impairment, living alone,  cerebrovascular disease, Charlson comorbidity index score, and exhaustion level-in  combination explained 32% of variation in this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Global  cognitive performance was most strongly associated with long-term cognitive decline  following delirium. Pre-surgical factors may substantially predict this outcome.","2017-11-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1697-1702","","12","72","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2017.

Yet, it remains unclear whether socioeconomic inequalities in health at late age  appear in relation to multimorbidity, particularly in Korea where social support  remains unsatisfactory for older people. Using three waves of Korea Health Panel,  data of 19,942 observations with repeated measure were constructed to ensure a  temporal sequence between three socioeconomic measures (i.e., poverty, employment  status, and education) and multimorbidity with a t to t+1 year transition. A  multilevel multinomial model was applied to quantify the socioeconomic impact across  different age, diseases and disease groups, both separately and in combination.  There were associations between socioeconomic position (SEP) and multimorbidity, and  increasing trends of socioeconomic inequalities not only with greater number of  morbidity but also with age. The latter result was only observed with employment  status through mid-to-early old age; i.e., between the 40s (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45,  95% confidence interval (CI):1.08-5.57) and 70s (OR = 3.48, 95%CI: 1.24-9.74). The  patterns of socioeconomic inequalities in multimorbidity varied for particular pairs  of diseases and were stronger in the disease pairs co-occurring with mental and  cardiovascular diseases but weaker in the disease pairs co-occurring with cancer.  Accumulation of adversity tended to intensify with increase in number of diseases  and older age, though this finding was not consistently supported. The labour market  should be encouraged to actively participate in actions to promote healthy aging  needs to be complemented by the provision of more generous and universal income  support to the elderly in Korea.","2017","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0173770","","3","12","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28296975  PMCID: PMC5351993","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Republic of Korea/epidemiology; *Social Class; *Comorbidity; *Social Justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little data is available. OBJECTIVE: To present  gait pattern of healthy older specially selected to be ""healthy walkers"". METHOD:  Fifty-seven older people benefited from a geriatric assessment including clinical  and functional evaluations to include only those without gait disorders. Gait data  were simultaneously recorded using a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the waist and  four 3D position markers placed on the feet at the level of the heel and the toe.  Volunteers walked at comfortable self-selected speed (CW), fast self-selected speed  (FW), and finally in dual task walking condition (DTW). The extracted gait  parameters were: gait speed, stride length, stride frequency, regularity and  symmetry, swing, stance and double support time and ratio and minimum toe clearance.  Gait speed and stride length were normalized to the right leg length. RESULTS:  Fifty-seven older people with a mean age of 69.7 ± 4.2 years old (range from 65 to  82 years) were included. Data were analyzed according to the gender and according to  the age (<70 or ≥70 years old). After normalization to leg length, the main  significant differences were shown for stride length and minimum toe clearance in  CW, FW and in DTW that were shorter in women. The regularity in FW was significantly  lower among older volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a data set considering  14 gait parameters obtained from 57 healthy old people strictly selected and  assessed for three walking conditions and shows that GS, SL and MTC have to be  related to the gender. The age-related impact on gait performances appears reduced  in this cohort.","2017-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1201-1209","","6","29","","Aging Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 28247211","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Health Status; Reference Values; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Biomechanical Phenomena; Leg/physiology; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; Gait; Accelerometers; Accelerometry/methods; Comfortable; Dual task; Fast; Foot/physiology; Gait/*physiology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Kinematics; Reference values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING:  Southern California community. PARTICIPANTS: White men (n=373) and women (n=552),  aged 50-96 years from the Rancho Bernardo Study, a longitudinal study of  cardiovascular disease risk factors and healthy aging. MEASUREMENTS: During the  1992-1996 research clinic visit, a food frequency questionnaire was used to  determine daily sodium intake; cognitive function was assessed with Trails Making  Test, part B (Trails B), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Verbal Fluency Test  (VFT); and medical, clinical and demographic information was obtained. Linear  regression was used to assess the association between calorie-adjusted sodium intake  and cognitive test scores with adjustment for demographic, behavioral and health  measures. Logistic regression examined the odds of having cognitive impairment by  sodium intake. RESULTS: Lower sodium intake was associated with poorer performance  on Trails B (p=0.008) and MMSE (p=0.003) after controlling for age, sex, and  education. Associations did not differ by sex, but there was a significant  interaction by age for the Trails B: older (≥80 years), but not younger, adults  showed worse performance with lower sodium intake (p=0.03). Associations remained  significant after additional adjustment for smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, body  weight, cardiovascular risk factors, kidney function, diuretic medication use, and  diet quality. Lower daily sodium intake was associated with increased odds of  cognitive impairment on the MMSE (score < 26; OR per SD decrease = 1.12, 95% CI  1.08, 1.16). Concluson: Lower sodium intake was associated with worse cognitive  function in older community-dwelling adults. For the maintenance of cognitive  health, older adults may be advised to avoid very low sodium diets.","2017","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:41:13","","276-283","","3","21","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28244567  PMCID: PMC5334786","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Health; Risk Factors; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Aging; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Demography; Prospective Studies; Body Weight; Logistic Models; Diuretics; Smoking; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Linear Models; Cognition/*physiology; *aging; *diet; California; *cognitive function; Aging/physiology; Residence Characteristics; *Feeding Behavior; Alcohol Drinking; *Sodium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cognition Disorders/*psychology; Sodium, Dietary/*analysis; Cognition Disorders; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Linear Regression; Cognition -- Evaluation; Eating Behavior; Logistic Regression; Sodium, Dietary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recollection is dependent on attentional control, which has been  shown to be disrupted in early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas familiarity  is independent of attention. The present longitudinal study examines the sensitivity  of recollection estimates based on Jacoby's (1991) process dissociation procedure to  AD-related biomarkers in a large sample of well-characterized cognitively normal  middle-aged and older adults (N = 519) and the extent to which recollection  discriminates these individuals from individuals with very mild symptomatic AD (N =  64). METHOD: Participants studied word pairs (e.g., knee bone), then completed a  primed, explicit, cued fragment-completion memory task (e.g., knee b_n_). Primes  were either congruent with the correct response (e.g., bone), incongruent (e.g.,  bend), or neutral (e.g., &&&). This design allowed for the estimation of independent  contributions of recollection and familiarity processes, using the process  dissociation procedure. RESULTS: Recollection, but not familiarity, was impaired in  healthy aging and in very mild AD. Recollection discriminated cognitively normal  individuals from the earliest detectable stage of symptomatic AD above and beyond  standard psychometric tests. In cognitively normal individuals, baseline CSF  measures indicative of AD pathology were related to lower initial recollection and  less practice-related improvement in recollection over time. Finally, presence of  amyloid plaques, as imaged by PIB-PET, was also related to less improvement in  recollection over time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that attention-demanding  memory processes, such as recollection, may be particularly sensitive to both  symptomatic and preclinical AD pathology.

However, it is a largely open question whether and how perceived control changes  from midadulthood to very old age and how such change is shaped by health and social  contexts. To examine these questions, we apply growth models to up to 15-year 4-wave  longitudinal data from the German Ageing Survey (DEAS; N = 10,081; aged 40-85 years  at baseline; 49% women). Results revealed that perceived control is relatively  stable in midlife, but starts to decline after midlife. Starting at 70, perceived  control declines an average of a quarter of a SD per 10 years. Suffering from  comorbidity and functional limitations were each associated with considerably lower  perceived control. Volunteering and less loneliness were each uniquely associated  with higher perceived control, over and above the other social factors as well as  sociodemographic and health variables. Surprisingly, less social support was  associated with stronger perceived control. We also found significant interaction  effects suggesting that the combination of functional limitations with older age and  loneliness with lower education were each associated with particularly compromised  perceived control. Overall we found little evidence for correlates of change in  perceived control, with only the loneliness-control association becoming slightly  weaker over time. We take our findings to suggest that various different facets of  social integration later in life are uniquely relevant for perceived control and  suggest routes for further inquiry.

This study aimed to assess the  short-term composite effect of diet, physical activity, psychosocial health, and  waist circumference (WC) on the incidence of DM in the elderly and to provide a  lifestyle-based predictive index.We used baseline measurements (2009-2013) of 5349  community-dwelling participants (aged 55 years and older, 52% female) of the Healthy  Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) for fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C, serum  cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressures, WC, and outcomes of home-visit  questionnaire. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify participants  with a healthy lifestyle (HLF: higher diet, physical activity, and psychosocial  scores) and a lower WC, with cutoffs determined by the receiver-operating  characteristics. A Cox regression model was applied to 3424 participants without DM  at baseline by linking to their National Health Insurance records (median follow-up  of 3.1 years).In total, 247 new DM cases (7.2%) were identified. The HLF and lower  WC group had a relative risk (RR) of DM of 0.54 (95% CI 0.35-0.82) compared to the  non-HLF and higher WC group. When stratified by the presence of impaired glucose  tolerance (IGT) or metabolic syndrome (MS), only participants with IGT/MS showed  significant risks (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.33-0.92). However, except for WC, the  individual lifestyle factors were nonsignificant in the overall model without PCA.A  composite protective effect of HLF and normal WC on DM within 5 years was observed,  especially in those with IGT or MS. Psychosocial health constituted an important  lifestyle factor in the elderly. The cutoffs identified could be used as a  lifestyle-based risk index for DM.

A particular focus of these studies is group differences and  identification of participants at risk of deteriorating to a worse diagnosis. For  this, statistical analysis using linear mixed-effects (LME) models are used to  account for correlated observations from individuals measured over time. A Bayesian  framework for LME models in AD is introduced in this paper to provide additional  insight often not found in current LME volumetric analyses. SETTING AND  PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal neuroimaging case study of ageing was analysed in this  research on 260 participants diagnosed as either healthy controls (HC), mild  cognitive impaired (MCI) or AD. Bayesian LME models for the ventricle and  hippocampus regions were used to: (1) estimate how the volumes of these regions  change over time by diagnosis, (2) identify high-risk non-AD individuals with AD  like degeneration and (3) determine probabilistic trajectories of diagnosis groups  over age. RESULTS: We observed (1) large differences in the average rate of change  of volume for the ventricle and hippocampus regions between diagnosis groups, (2)  high-risk individuals who had progressed from HC to MCI and displayed similar rates  of deterioration as AD counterparts, and (3) critical time points which indicate  where deterioration of regions begins to diverge between the diagnosis groups.  CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Bayesian  LME models to neuroimaging data which provides inference on a population and  individual level in the AD field. The application of a Bayesian LME framework allows  for additional information to be extracted from longitudinal studies. This provides  health professionals with valuable information of neurodegeneration stages, and a  potential to provide a better understanding of disease pathology.","2017-02-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e012174","","2","7","","BMJ Open","","","","","","","","eng","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Design Prospective population-based cohort. Setting Inhabitants of Ommoord, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Participants A total of 1405 men and 2122 women, mean (standard deviation) age 75.9 (6.4) years. Main measures We included 7 domains in the total score of HAS: chronic diseases, mental health, cognitive function, physical function, pain, social support, and quality of life; each scored 0, 1, or 2 in each domain. A total score (range 0–14) was constructed and was assessed continuously and in tertiles (13–14: healthy aging, 11–12: intermediate aging, 0–10: poor aging). Sex-specific change in the mean HAS was computed for the age categories of 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, and ≥85 years. The association between HAS and mortality was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models. Results Mean follow-up was 8.6 (3.4) years. Men had poorer scores in the chronic disease domain than women. However, women had poorer mental health, worse physical function, more pain, and lower quality of life compared with men. The prevalence of healthy aging was higher in men (n = 396, 28.2%), than in women (n = 526, 24.8%). The mean (standard deviation) HAS was 11.1 (2.2) in men and 10.7 (2.3) in women. Mean HAS was higher in men than in women for all age categories. The β for change in mean HAS across the 5 increasing age categories was −0.55 (−0.65 to −0.45) in men and −0.65 (−0.73 to −0.57) in women. The age-adjusted hazard ratio per unit increase in HAS with mortality was 0.86 (0.83–0.89) in men, and 0.89 (0.87–0.91) in women. Conclusions Levels of HAS were lower in women compared with men, in all age categories. The HAS declined with increasing age for both sexes, albeit slightly steeper in women. The HAS was strongly associated with mortality in both sexes. A better understanding of population healthy aging and sex differences in this regard could aid to implement strategies for sustainable healthcare in aging populations.","2017-03-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:40:28","","276.e1-276.e7","","3","18","","J Am Med Dir Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

In this study we aimed to assess the clinical value of subjective  cognitive impairment (SCI) by examining the cross-sectional relationship between  β-amyloid load and SCI. Cerebral β-amyloid and SCI was assessed in a cohort of 112  cognitively normal subjects. Subjective cognition was evaluated using specific  questions on memory and cognition and the MAC-Q. Participants had cerebral β-amyloid  load measured with (18)F-Florbetaben Positron Emission Tomography (PET). No  associations were found between measures of subjective memory impairment and  cerebral β-amyloid. However, by self-reported confusion was predictive of a higher  global β-amyloid burden (p = 0.002), after controlling for confounders.

METHOD: The study used baseline and  follow-up data from the 2008-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N =  17,230; age = 51-101).

RESULTS: Individual resources were unequally distributed across age  group and social structures (education, wealth, race, gender) and had a cumulative  effect on all successful aging outcomes. For experienced well-being, individual  resources were most important at midlife and for groups with lower education.  Person-environment congruence (social cohesion, city satisfaction) was associated  with all successful aging outcomes and conditioned the effect of individual  resources on experienced well-being. DISCUSSION: A cumulative index allows for  gradations in resources that can be compensated for by external factors such as  person-environment congruence.

However, it is unclear which demographic,  psychosocial, behavioral and health factors are associated with self-perceived  uselessness. METHODS: Data came from four waves (2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014) of the  largest nationwide longitudinal survey of the population aged 65 and older in China  (26,624 individuals contributed 48,476 observations). This study aimed to  systematically investigate factors associated with self-perceived uselessness based  on the proposed REHAB framework that includes resources (R), environments (E),  health (H), fixed attributes (A) and behaviors (B). Self-perceived uselessness was  measured by a single item: ""with age, do you feel more useless?"" and coded by  frequency: high (always and often), moderate (sometimes) and low (seldom and never).  Multinomial logistic regression models with low frequency as the reference category  were employed to identify REHAB risk factors associated with self-perceived  uselessness. RESULTS: Most factors in the REHAB framework were associated with  self-perceived uselessness, although some social environmental factors in the full  model were not significant. Specifically, more socioeconomic resources were  associated with reduced relative risk ratio (RRR) of high or moderate frequency of  self-perceived uselessness relative to low frequency. More environmental  family/social support was associated with lower RRR of high frequency of  self-perceived uselessness. Cultural factors such as coresidence with children and  intergenerational transfer were associated with reduced RRR of high frequency of  self-perceived uselessness. Indicators of poor health status such as disability and  loneliness were associated with greater RRR of high or moderate frequency of  self-perceived uselessness. Fixed attributes of older age and Han ethnicity were  associated with increased RRR of high frequency of self-perceived uselessness;  whereas optimism and self-control were associated with reduced RRR. Behaviors  including regular consumption of alcohol, regular exercise, social participation and  leisure activities were associated with reduced RRR of high frequency of  self-perceived uselessness. CONCLUSIONS: Self-perceived uselessness was associated  with a wide range of factors in the REHAB framework. The findings could have  important implications for China to develop and target community health programs to  improve self-perceived usefulness among older adults.","2017-01-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","12","","1","17","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 28068931  PMCID: PMC5223574","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; *Successful aging; *Social Support; China/epidemiology; *China; *Older adults; *Health Status; Social Participation/*psychology; *Self Concept; Loneliness/*psychology; *Self-perceived uselessness; *Self-perception of aging; *Usefulness; Leisure Activities/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to examine longitudinal age effects on  inhibition and switching, two key subfunctions of EF, calculated from results on the  Color Word Interference Test (CWIT). METHODS: One hundred twenty-three healthy aging  individuals (average age 61.4 years; 67% women) performed the CWIT up to three  times, over a period of more than 6 years. Measures of inhibition, switching, and  combined inhibition and switching were analyzed. A longitudinal linear mixed effects  models analysis was run including basic CWIT conditions, and measures of processing  speed, retest effect, gender, education, and age as predictors. RESULTS: After  taking all predictors into account, age added significantly to the predictive value  of the longitudinal models of (i) inhibition, (ii) switching, and (iii) combined  inhibition and switching. The basic CWIT conditions and the processing speed measure  added to the predictive value of the models, while retest effect, gender, and  education did not. CONCLUSIONS: The present study on middle-aged to older  individuals showed age-related decline in inhibition and switching abilities.

This study examines negative mood and depressive occurrence in the menopausal stages to provide a better understanding of prevalence of mood disturbance during this period.Methods: This study was a longitudinal assessment of variables drawn from an epidemiological prospective study of women's healthy aging. Scores were analyzed using general linear mixed models to determine whether there were reductions in negative mood across the stages of the menopausal transition, including the substages of the early and late postmenopause, as defined by Stages of Reproductive Ageing Workshop+10 criteria. Negative mood scores, derived from the Affectometer 2, were obtained at 11 time points between 1992 and 2012 in a group of 438 Melbourne-based, community-dwelling women aged between 45 and 55 years at baseline (n = 234; 53% retention in 2012). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale administered at three time points for 10 years.Results: Women's experience of negative mood and depressive symptoms was highest during the menopausal transition and lowest in the late postmenopause. Increasing age was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms F(1,559) = 14.83, P < 0.001 and negative mood F(1,935) = 14.97, P < 0.001. When controlling for age, there was no difference found between the early and late postmenopause stage mean scores.Conclusions: Although there were differences found between negative mood and depressive symptom scores in relation to categories of reproductive aging, age was found to be the driving influence to their association.","2017-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:09:31","","490-496","","5","24","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27922940","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Human; Scales; Psychometrics; Depressive Disorder/epidemiology/*psychology; Menopause/*psychology; Mood Disorders/epidemiology/psychology; Victoria/epidemiology; Victoria; Middle Age; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Depression -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Affective Disorders -- Epidemiology; Affective Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Menopause -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort of individuals  aged 70 and older undergoing elective surgery, enrolled from June 2010 to August  2013. SETTING: Two academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older  adults (N = 566; mean age ± standard deviation 77 ± 5) undergoing major elective  surgery and expected to be admitted for at least 3 days. MEASUREMENTS: Readmission  was assessed in multiple interviews with participants and family members over 18  months and validated against medical record review. Physical function was assessed  according to ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and  activities of daily living (ADL), Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Survey  Physical Component Summary score, and a standardized functional composite. RESULTS:  Two hundred fifty-five (45%) participants experienced 503 readmissions. Readmissions  were associated with delays in functional recovery in all measures of physical  function. Having two or more readmissions over 18 months was associated with  persistent and significantly greater risk of IADL dependence (relative risk (RR) =  1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-2.3) and ADL dependence (RR = 3.3, 95% CI =  1.7-6.4). Degree of functional impairment increased progressively with number of  readmissions. Readmissions within 2 months resulted in delayed functional recovery  to baseline by 18 months, and readmissions between 12 and 18 months after surgery  resulted in loss of functional recovery previously achieved.

This study aims to examine and longitudinally follow health status  and disease risk factors in a Swiss rural cohort, evaluating all health-related  research and practice disciplines to assure development of new implementable and  successful preventive strategies for healthy ageing. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: Small  Swiss villages with low migration rates will be selected for this study. 2 villages  (Cama/Lostallo) have already been selected as initial study sites. All residents  (age ≥6 years, no upper age limit) are eligible. The target enrolment number per  village is 300. Examinations and measurements encompass medical history,  anthropometry, cardiac and vascular health, pulmonary function, physical  performance, nutritional, mental and emotional status, biochemical and molecular  analyses. Follow-up examinations (identical to baseline) will be performed after 5  and 10 years, and in 10-year intervals thereafter. The major objective is to assess,  and observe change in, health status over time in a prospective manner. Secondary  objectives are to: (1) identify 'hidden' (asymptomatic and/or unrecognised) health  problems which enhance risk for chronic diseases; (2) identify barriers to accessing  healthcare and adapting health behaviours; (3) evaluate efficacy of present  preventive strategies and recommendations; (4) evaluate knowledge and attitude  towards ongoing health programmes and public health recommendations; (5) monitor  change and progress towards the national health objectives; (6) formulate new  preventive strategies and recommendations based on the findings and knowledge base  of the past 10 years; (7) formulate models for successful prevention of chronic  diseases and for healthy ageing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee of  Nordwest-und Zentralschweiz approved this study (EKNZ 2014-209). It is registered at  ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02282748).

To date, no study has examined the association between smoking and cognitive decline in men living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim of this present study is to examine whether smoking status and severity in midlife is associated with a rate of decline in cognitive processing speed among older HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative men who have sex with men. Data from 591 older HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative men who have sex with men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study were examined. All participants had information on smoking history collected before age 50 years and at least 5 years of follow-up after age 50. Smoking history was categorized as never smoker, former smoker, and current smoker and cumulative pack years was calculated. The raw scores of three neuropsychological tests (Trail Making A, Trail Making B, and Symbol Digit Modalities tests) were log transformed (Trail Making A and B) and used in linear mixed models to determine associations between smoking history and at least subsequent 5-year decline in cognitive processing speed. There were no significant differences in the rates of neurological decline among never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. Findings were similar among HIV-seropositive participants. However, an increase of 5 pack-years was statistically significantly associated with a greater rate of decline in the Trail Making Test B score and Composite Score (β -0.0250 [95% CI, -0.0095 to -0.0006] and -0.0077 [95% CI, -0.0153 to -0.0002], respectively). We found no significant association between smoking treated as a categorical variable (never smoked, former smoker, or current smoker) and a small change in every increase of 5 pack-years on measures of psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility. To optimize healthy aging, interventions for smoking cessation should be tailored to men who have sex with men.","2017-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:52:35","","239-249","","2","23","","J Neurovirol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27889886  PMCID: PMC5663220","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Male; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Case-Control Studies; Smoking; Homosexuality, Male; *HIV; *Neurocognition; *Neuropsychological test; *Smoking; Cognitive Dysfunction/complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/virology; HIV Infections/complications/*diagnosis/physiopathology/virology; Smoking/*physiopathology; HIV; Cognitive Dysfunction -- diagnosis; Cognitive Dysfunction -- complications; Cognitive Dysfunction -- physiopathology; Cognitive Dysfunction -- virology; HIV Infections -- complications; HIV Infections -- diagnosis; HIV Infections -- physiopathology; HIV Infections -- virology; Neurocognition; Neuropsychological test; Smoking -- physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recruitment and data collection started in 2006 and follow-up is  planned for 30years. The central aim of LifeLines is to understand healthy ageing in  the 21st century. Here, the study design, methods, baseline and major cardiovascular  phenotypes of the LifeLines Cohort Study are presented. METHODS AND RESULTS:  Baseline cardiovascular phenotypes were defined in 9700 juvenile (8-18years) and  152,180 adult (≥18years) participants. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined  using ICD-10 criteria. At least one cardiovascular risk factor was present in 73% of  the adult participants. The prevalence, adjusted for the Dutch population, was  determined for risk factors (hypertension (33%), hypercholesterolemia (19%),  diabetes (4%), overweight (56%), and current smoking (19%)) and CVD (myocardial  infarction (1.8%), heart failure (1.0%), and atrial fibrillation (1.3%)). Overall  CVD prevalence increased with age from 9% in participants<65years to 28% in  participants≥65years. Of the participants with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia  and diabetes, respectively 75%, 96% and 41% did not receive preventive  pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The contemporary LifeLines Cohort Study provides  researchers with unique and novel opportunities to study environmental, phenotypic,  and genetic risk factors for CVD and is expected to improve our knowledge on healthy  ageing. In this contemporary Western cohort we identified a remarkable high  percentage of untreated CVD risk factors suggesting that not all opportunities to  reduce the CVD burden are utilised.","2017-02-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","495-500","","","228","","Int J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.

The objective was to identify predictors of poor health outcome at 10 years of  follow-up in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). DESIGN: Prospective  cohort study. SETTING: Population-based sample from 6 U.S. communities.  PARTICIPANTS: 4,355 participants In the MESA Study. MEASUREMENTS: Poor health  outcome at 10 years of follow-up was defined as having died or having clinical  cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease, or cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. Absolute risk  regression was used to estimate risk differences in the outcome adjusting for  demographic variables, clinical and behavioral risk factors, subclinical  cardiovascular disease, and ApoE genotype. Models were weighted to account for  selective attrition. RESULTS: Mean age at 10 years of follow-up was 69.5 years;  1,480 participants had a poor health outcome, 2,157 participants were in good  health, and 718 were unknown. Older age, smoking, not taking a statin, hypertension,  diabetes, and higher coronary calcium score were associated with higher probability  of poor health outcome. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the lowest  income and educational categories had 7 to 14% greater absolute risk of poor health  outcome at 10 years of follow-up compared to those in the next highest categories of  income or education (P = 0.002 for both). Those in the lowest categories of both  income and education had 21% greater absolute risk of poor health outcome compared  to those in the highest categories of both income and education. CONCLUSIONS: Low  income and educational level predict poor health outcome at 10 years of follow-up in  an aging cohort, independent of clinical and behavioral risk factors and subclinical  cardiovascular disease.","2016","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","e0165651","","11","11","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27875557  PMCID: PMC5119729","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; *Atherosclerosis/complications/mortality; *Cognition Disorders/etiology/mortality; *Depression/etiology/mortality; *Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/etiology/mortality; Skin Neoplasms/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: this  study aimed to examine the prospective association between physical activity and  subsequent hospital care utilisation in older adults and to explore the optimal dose  of physical activity required to reduce hospital care utilisation. DESIGN: this was  a prospective cohort study based on the data from the Taiwan 2005 National Health  Interview Survey, which were linked to the 2005-12 claims data from the National  Health Insurance system. PARTICIPANTS: 1,760 older adults aged 65 or more. METHODS:  the frequency, duration and intensity for physical activity were assessed, and total  physical activity energy expenditure was estimated. The average annualised hospital  care utilisation for the period 2006 through 2012, including number of  hospitalisations, number of days in hospital and the costs of hospitalisation, were  calculated. RESULTS: older adults engaging in at least moderate volume of physical  activity (≥1,000 kcal/week) experienced fewer subsequent hospital admissions and  fewer days in hospital than did sedentary individuals, after adjusting for  covariates. Trends for reduced hospitalisation costs were also found. These  associations persisted in sensitivity analyses, including tests of reverse  causation. CONCLUSION: this study has provided evidence that older adults who are at  least moderately active may minimise utilisation of hospital care services. The  findings highlight the importance of maintaining a physically active lifestyle in  later life.","2017-05-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","452-459","","3","46","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

METHODS: data were from 10,798 men  and women aged 50 years and older in the population-based English Longitudinal Study  of Ageing in 2002/03, randomly split into development (n = 5,377) and validation  cohorts (n = 5,421). Participants were asked about their sociodemographics, health  behaviours, comorbidities, and functional status in the home-based interviews.  Variables that were independently associated with all-cause mortality through March  2013 in the development cohort were weighted relative to one another to develop risk  point scores for the index that was calibrated in the validation cohort. RESULTS:  the validated 10-year mortality risk index assigns points for: increasing age (50-59  years: 0 points; 60-64: 1 point; 65-69: 3 points; 70-74: 5 points; 75-79: 7 points;  80-84: 9 points; ≥85: 12 points), male (2 points), no vigorous physical activity (1  point), smoking (2 points), having a diagnosis of cancer (1 point), chronic lung  disease (2 points) or heart failure (4 points), and having difficulty preparing a  hot meal (2 points), pushing or pulling large objects (1 point) or walking 100 yards  (1 point). In the full study cohort, 10-year mortality rates increased from 1.7%  (11/664) in those with 0 points to 95% (189/199) among those with ≥16 points.  CONCLUSION: this highly predictive 10-item mortality risk index is valid in the  English population aged 50 years and older. It uses simple information that is often  available in research studies and patient reports, and does not require biomarker  data to predict mortality.","2017-05-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","427-432","","3","46","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

This study reports risk factors for late-life depression and correlates of antidepressant using the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study (CRELES), a nationally representative cohort of adults age 60 and over.Methods: CRELES contains baseline interviews in 2005 (n=2827) with follow-up interviews in 2007 and 2009. CRELES used the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form to identify depression using cut-offs for mild and severe depression and contained a 14-question assessment to determine physical disability. Participants self-reported antidepressant use and chronic health conditions. We examined correlates of newly screened depression and new antidepressant use among participants not depressed or not using antidepressants in the previous study wave. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate the association among variables.Results: Increases in disability were associated with newly screening for mild and severe depression. New medical conditions and recent widowhood were associated with newly screening for severe depression. Recent widowhood was also associated with new use of antidepressant medication.Limitations: Limitations of this study include absence of persons living in institutions, inconsistency of screening tools with clinical diagnoses, and possible effects of stigma and recall bias on screening.Conclusions: Risk factors for late-life depression in Costa Rica are similar to risk factors in high-income countries. Patterns of antidepressant use suggest providers may recognize the role of bereavement as a risk factor for late-life depression but not of disability or chronic conditions.","2017-01-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:03:15","","338-344","","","208","","J Affect Disord","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the association of lifetime opiate and  cocaine use with reduced kidney function, albuminuria and rapid kidney function  decline among urban-dwelling adults. METHODS: Our prospective cohort included 2,286  Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study participants  who were community-dwelling adults residing in Baltimore, MD. The predictive  variables were lifetime opiate and cocaine use, defined as use of opiates or  crack/cocaine ≥5 times. Outcomes included prevalent reduced estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR; <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 by Chronic Kidney Disease  (CKD)-Epidemiology Collaboration), albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30  mg/g, n = 1,652) and rapid kidney function decline (>3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year over  a median of 4.7 years, n = 1,660). RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 48 years, 15%  reported opiate use, and 22% reported cocaine use. A total of 115 (5.0%)  participants had reduced eGFR, 190 (11.5%) had albuminuria and 230 (13.8%)  experienced rapid decline in kidney function. In adjusted logistic regression  analyses, both substances were associated with greater odds of reduced eGFR (OR  2.71, 95% CI 1.50-4.89 for opiates; OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.87-2.24 for cocaine). Both  substances were associated with greater odds of albuminuria (OR 1.20, 95% CI  0.83-1.73 for opiates; OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.29-2.51 for cocaine). Neither substance was  associated with the rapid decline of kidney function. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime opiate  and cocaine use was associated with prevalent reduced eGFR and albuminuria, yet not  with rapid kidney function decline. The use of opiate and cocaine may be an  important risk factor for CKD in urban populations.","2016","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:42:20","","447-453","","6","44","","Am J Nephrol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 S.

We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between  early morning oral temperature (95.0-98.6 °F) and usual gait speed, endurance walk  performance, fatigability, and grip strength in 762 non-frail men (52 %) and women  aged 65-89 years participating in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Since  excessive adiposity (body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2) or waist-to-height ratio ≥0.62) may  alter temperature set point, associations were also examined within adiposity  strata. Overall, controlling for age, race, sex, height, exercise, and adiposity,  lower temperature was associated with faster gait speed, less time to walk 400 m  quickly, and lower perceived exertion following 5-min of walking at 0.67 m/s (all  p ≤ 0.02). In the non-adipose (N = 662), these associations were more robust (all  p ≤ 0.006). Direction of association was reversed in the adipose (N = 100), but none  attained significance (all p > 0.22). Over 2.2 years, basal temperature was not  associated with functional change in the overall population or non-adipose. Among  the adipose, lower baseline temperature was associated with greater decline in  endurance walking performance (p = 0.006). In longitudinal analyses predicting  future functional performance, low temperature in the non-adipose was associated  with faster gait speed (p = 0.021) and less time to walk 400 m quickly (p = 0.003),  whereas in the adipose, lower temperature was associated with slower gait speed  (p = 0.05) and more time to walk 400 m (p = 0.008).

OBJECTIVES: To (1)  describe secondary health conditions, activity limitations, and life satisfaction in  older adults with long-term SCI, and to (2) investigate how sociodemographics,  injury characteristics, and secondary health conditions are associated with their  activity limitations and life satisfaction. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive  cohort study. SETTING: Home and community settings. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 123  individuals (71% men, injury levels C1-L5, American Spinal Injury Association  Impairment Scale A-D), mean age 63 years, mean time since injury 24 years. METHODS:  Baseline data as part of the Swedish Aging with Spinal Cord Injury Study.  Associations between variables were investigated with multivariable linear  regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Bowel and bladder function,  nociceptive and neuropathic pain, spasticity, the Spinal Cord Independence Measure,  third version, and the Satisfaction With Life Scale. RESULTS: Bowel-related and  bladder-related problems were reported by 32% and 44%, respectively, 66% reported  moderate or severe nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain, and 44% reported spasticity.  Activity limitations were moderate (mean Spinal Cord Independence Measure, third  version, total score 65.2, range 8-100) where injury characteristics and spasticity  explained 68% of the variance. Higher level and more severe SCI (based on the  American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale) exhibited the strongest  association with more activity limitations. Life satisfaction was rated just above  the midpoint between satisfied and dissatisfied with life (mean Satisfaction With  Life Scale total score 20.7, range 6-34). Marital status, vocational situation,  bladder function and injury characteristics explained 38% of the variance, where  having a partner showed the strongest association with greater life satisfaction.  Activity limitations and life satisfaction were not associated with gender, age and  time since injury. CONCLUSION: Older adults with long-term SCI can maintain a  relatively high level of physical independence and generally are satisfied with  their lives, regardless of gender, age or time since injury. The associations  demonstrate the importance of injury characteristics for the performance of daily  activities and the social context for life satisfaction in older adults with  long-term SCI.

Although poor grip strength is more prevalent in older  disabled African American women, little is known about the association between race  and poverty-related disparities and grip strength in middle-aged men and women.  METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional relationship between race, socioeconomic  status as assessed by household income, and hand grip strength in men and women in  the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study. General  linear models examined grip strength (maximum of two trials on both sides) by race  and household income adjusted for age, weight, height, hand pain, education,  insurance status, family income, and two or more chronic conditions. RESULTS: Of  2,091 adults, 422(45.4%) were male, 509(54.8%) were African American, and 320  (34.5%) were living in households with incomes below 125% of the federal poverty  level (low SES). In adjusted models, African American women had greater grip  strength than White women independent of SES (low income household: 29.3 vs 26.9 kg  and high income household: 30.5 vs. 28.3kg; P<.05 for both); whereas in men, only  African Americans in the high income household group had better grip strength than  Whites (46.3 vs. 43.2; P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between grip strength,  race and SES as assessed by household income varied in this cohort. Efforts to  develop grip strength norms and cut points that indicate frailty and sarcopenia may  need to be race- and income-specific.","2016-10-20","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:43:10","","493-500","","4","26","","Ethn Dis","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","PMID: 27773976  PMCID: PMC5072478","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Prevalence; African Americans; European Continental Ancestry Group; Social Class; *Aging; *Social Class; *Disabled Persons; Hand Strength; Income; Chronic Disease; *Hand Strength; *African Americans; *European Continental Ancestry Group; *Health Disparities; *Physical Function; *Race; Disabled Persons; Health Disparities; Physical Function; Race","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN:  Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity  across the Life Span study. SUBJECTS: A total of 1,534 urban dwelling participants  of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study with a  baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/minute/1.73 m(2).  INTERVENTION: DASH diet accordance determined via a score based on nine target  nutrients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rapid kidney function decline (eGFR decline >3  mL/minute/1.73 m(2) per year), incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) (follow-up eGFR  <60 mL/minute/1.73 m(2)), and eGFR decline >25%. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was  48 years, and 59% were African-American. Median DASH score was 1.5 (range, 0-8).  Over a median of 5 years, 13.4% experienced rapid eGFR decline, including 15.2%  among participants not following a DASH-accordant diet (score ≤1) and 12.0% with  higher accordance (score >1) (P = .08). Outcomes varied by hypertension status. In  multinomial logistic regression models, following adjustment for sociodemographic  and clinical factors, including total energy intake, low DASH diet accordance was  associated with rapid eGFR decline among participants with hypertension (risk ratio,  1.68; 95% confidence interval: 1.17-2.42) but not among those without hypertension  (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-1.24; P interaction .001). There  was no statistically significant association between DASH diet accordance and  incident CKD or eGFR decline >25%. Results were similar when DASH diet accordance  was analyzed in tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Among urban adults, low accordance to a  DASH-type diet was not associated with incident CKD, but was associated with higher  risk of rapid eGFR decline among those with hypertension, yet not among those  without hypertension. Further study of dietary patterns as a potential target for  improving kidney outcomes among high-risk populations is warranted.","2017-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","16-25","","1","27","","J Ren Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

The  aim of this study was to investigate if adherence to the Mediterranean diet is  associated with a lower prevalence of OA of the knee in a large cohort from North  America. METHODS: 4358 community-dwelling participants (2527 females; mean age: 61.2  years) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included. Adherence to the  Mediterranean diet was evaluated through a validated Mediterranean diet score (aMED)  categorized into quartiles (Q). Knee OA was diagnosed both clinically and  radiologically. The strength of the association between aMED (divided in quartiles)  and knee OA was investigated through a logistic regression analysis and reported as  odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential  confounders. RESULTS: Participants with a higher adherence to Mediterranean diet had  a significantly lower prevalence of knee OA compared to those with lower adherence  (Q4: 25.2% vs. Q1: 33.8%; p < 0.0001). Using a logistic regression analysis,  adjusting for 10 potential confounders with those in the lowest quartile of aMED as  reference, participants with the highest aMED had a significant reduction in  presence of knee OA (OR, 0.83; 95% CIs: 0.69-0.99, p = 0.04). Among the individual  components of Mediterranean diet, only higher use of cereals was associated with  lower odds of having knee OA (OR: 0.76; 95%CI: 0.60-0.98; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:  Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower prevalence of knee  OA.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two local municipalities of Nara, Japan.  PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 to 96 (n = 2,774 male, n = 3,586 female) free of  IADL disability at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: SP and IADLs were assessed using  self-administered questionnaires. SP was categorized into five types and assessed  using the number and type of social activities. IADLs were evaluated using the Tokyo  Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Logistic regression  analysis stratified according to sex was used to examine change in IADLs according  to SP, with nonparticipation as a reference. RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up,  13.6% of men and 9.0% of women reported IADL decline. After adjusting for age,  family structure, body mass index, pension, occupation, medical treatment,  self-rated health, drinking, smoking, depression, cognitive function, and activities  of daily living, participation in various social activities was inversely associated  with change in IADLs in women but not men.

Ideal cardiovascular health  (CVH), defined by the American Heart Association (AHA), has also been associated  with a reduced risk of CVD, but the relationship between telomere length and ideal  CVH is unclear. We measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL) by qPCR in 2568 American  Indians in the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). All participants were free of overt  CVD at enrollment (2001-2003). CVH indices included four behavioral factors  (smoking, physical activity, diet, BMI) and three health factors (blood pressure,  cholesterol, fasting glucose). Each index was categorized as poor, intermediate, or  ideal according to the AHA's guideline. CVH was further categorized into below  average (0-1), average (2-3) and above average (≥4) based on the total number of  ideal indices. Results showed that, 29, 50 and 21 % of study participants had below  average, average, and above average CVH, respectively. Participants with above  average CVH had significantly longer LTL than those with below average CVH  (β = 0.034, P = 0.042) after adjusting for age, sex, education level, marital  status, processed meat consumption, alcohol consumption, and study site. Compared to  the U.S. general population, American Indians achieved lower rates for five out of  the seven ideal CVH metrics, including smoking, BMI, physical activity, diet, and  blood pressure. Achieving four or more ideal CVH metrics was significantly  associated with longer LTL. This finding suggests that achieving an ideal CVH may  prevent or delay CVD, probably through promoting healthy aging.","2017-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","67-75","","1","32","","Eur J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27660162  PMCID: PMC5618104","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Diet; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Young Adult; Smoking/epidemiology; *Health Status; United States/epidemiology; Blood Pressure/physiology; Telomere/*genetics; Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology; Cholesterol/blood; *American Indians; *Biological aging; *Ideal cardiovascular health; *Indians, North American; *Leukocyte telomere length; *Leukocytes/metabolism; *Strong heart family study; Polymerase Chain Reaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we aim to estimate the effects of stressful life events in childhood and adulthood on  Successful Aging (SA). Second, we examine how unequal exposure to such life events  between individuals with different socioeconomic position (SEP) contributes to  socioeconomic inequalities in SA. METHOD: We used 16-year longitudinal data from  2,185 respondents aged 55-85 years in 1992 in the Dutch nationally representative  Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Measurement of SA was based on earlier work, in  which we integrated trajectories in 9 indicators of functioning into an index of SA.  Using path analysis, we investigated direct and indirect effects of parental and  adulthood SEP as well as of self-reported childhood and adulthood life events on SA.  RESULTS: Almost all included life events had negative direct effects on SA. Parental  SEP had no direct effect on SA, whereas adulthood SEP had. Higher Parental SEP  increased the likelihood of parental problems and parental death in childhood,  resulting in negative indirect effects on SA. Higher adulthood SEP had both positive  and negative indirect effects on SA, through increasing the likelihood of divorce  and unemployment, but decreasing the likelihood of occupational disability.  DISCUSSION: SEP and particular stressful life events are largely, but not entirely  independent predictors of SA. We found that high and low SEP may increase exposure  to particular events that negatively affect SA. Findings suggest that low  (childhood) SEP and stressful life events are interrelated factors that may limit  individual opportunities to age successfully.","2017-03-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","268-278","","2","72","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

We explored relations between early-life factors and cSVD in  the Lothian Birth Cohort, a healthy aging cohort. Participants were recruited at age  70 (N = 1091); most had completed a test of cognitive ability at age 11 as part of  the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947. Of those, 700 participants had brain MRI that  could be rated for cSVD conducted at age 73. Presence of lacunes, white matter  hyperintensities, microbleeds, and perivascular spaces were summed in a score of 0-4  representing all MRI cSVD features. We tested associations with early-life factors  using multivariate logistic regression. Greater SVD score was significantly  associated with lower age-11 IQ (OR higher SVD score per SD age-11 IQ = .78, 95%CI  0.65-.95, p=.01). The associations between SVD score and own job class (OR higher  job class, .64 95%CI .43-.95, p=.03), age-11 deprivation index (OR per point  deprivation score, 1.08, 95%CI 1.00-1.17, p=.04), and education (OR some qualifying  education, .60 95%CI .37-.98, p=.04) trended towards significance (p<.05 for all)  but did not meet thresholds for multiple testing. No early-life factor was  significantly associated with any one individual score component. Early-life factors  may contribute to age-73 burden of cSVD. These relations, and the potential for  early social interventions to improve brain health, deserve further study.","2016-09-19","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:49:38","","2039-2061","","9","8","","Aging (Albany NY)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27652981  PMCID: PMC5076451","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain -- diagnostic imaging; aging; Cognition/*physiology; *aging; *MRI; *risk factors; *stroke; *cerebral small vessel disease; Scotland; stroke; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; White Matter/*diagnostic imaging; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/psychology; Cost of Illness; risk factors; White Matter -- diagnostic imaging; MRI; cerebral small vessel disease; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases -- diagnostic imaging; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases -- etiology; Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PARTICIPANTS:  Postmenopausal women enrolled between 1993 and 1998 with baseline biomarker  assessments who had the potential to reach age 85 before September 2013 (N = 7,178).  MEASUREMENTS: Kidney function was measured according to estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from serum creatinine collected at baseline.  Outcomes were survival to age 85 with functional independence, survival with  disability, or death before age 85. Disability was defined as mobility or activity  of daily living limitations measured by questionnaire. RESULTS: eGFR was greater  than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) in 22.7% of women, 60 to 89 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) in  66.5%, 45 to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) in 8.7%, and less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)  in 2.0%.

It is in the preceding decades that an intervention is most likely to be effective, when informed by an understanding of factors contributing to the disease prodrome. Few studies, however, have sufficient longitudinal data on relevant risks to determine the optimum targets for interventions to improve cognition in aging. In this article we examine the timing and exposure of factors contributing to verbal memory performance in later life.Methods: 387 participants from the population-based Women's Healthy Ageing Project, mean age at baseline of 49.6 years (range: 45-55 years), had complete neuropsychiatric assessments, clinical information, physical measures, and biomarkers collected at baseline, with at least three follow-up visits that included at least one cognitive reassessment. Mixed linear models were conducted to assess the significance of risk factors on later-life verbal memory. We explored the influence of early, contemporaneous, and cumulative exposures.Results: Younger age and better education were associated with baseline memory test performance (CERAD). Over the 20 years of study follow-up, cumulative mid- to late-life physical activity had the strongest effect on better later life verbal memory (0.136 [0.058, 0.214]). The next most likely contributors to verbal memory in late life were the negative effect of cumulative hypertension (-0.033 [-0.047, -0.0.18] and the beneficial effect of HDL cholesterol (0.818 [0.042, 1.593]).Conclusions: Findings suggest that midlife interventions focused on physical activity, hypertension control, and achieving optimal levels of HDL cholesterol will help maintain later-life verbal memory skills.","2016-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:17:28","","857-867","","10","24","","Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

The association of these stages with longitudinal biomarker outcomes is unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To examine whether longitudinal Aβ accumulation and hippocampal atrophy  differ based on initial preclinical staging. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This  longitudinal population-based cohort study used data collected at the Knight  Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, from  December 1, 2006, to June 31, 2015. Cognitively normal older adults (n = 174) were  recruited from the longitudinal Adult Children Study and Healthy Aging and Senile  Dementia Study at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center. At baseline, all  participants had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, positron emission  tomography (PET) scans with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), and  cerebrospinal fluid assays of tau and phosphorylated tau (ptau) acquired within 12  months. Using the baseline biomarkers, individuals were classified into preclinical  stage 0 (Aβ-/ND-), 1 (Aβ+/ND-), or 2+ (Aβ+/ND+) or suspected non-AD pathophysiology  (SNAP; Aβ-/ND+). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subsequent longitudinal accumulation of  Aβ assessed with PiB PET and loss of hippocampal volume assessed with MRI in each  group. RESULTS: Among the 174 participants (81 men [46.6%]; 93 women [53.4%]; mean  [SD] age, 65.7 [8.9] years), a proportion (14%-17%) of individuals with  neurodegeneration alone (SNAP) later demonstrated Aβ+. The rates of Aβ accumulation  and loss of hippocampal volume in individuals with SNAP were indistinguishable from  those without any pathologic features at baseline (for Aβ accumulation: when  hippocampal volume was used to define ND, t = 0.00 [P > .99]; when tau and ptau were  used to define ND, t = -0.02 [P = .98]; for loss of hippocampal volume: when  hippocampal volume was used to define ND, t = -1.34 [P = .18]; when tau and ptau  were used to define ND, t = 0.84 [P = .40]). Later preclinical stages (stages 1 and  2+) had elevated Aβ accumulation. Using hippocampal volume to define ND, individuals  with stage 1 had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 11.06;  P < .001), stage 2+ (t = 2.10; P = .04), and SNAP (t = 9.32; P < .001), and those  with stage 2+ had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 4.38;  P < .001) and SNAP (t = 4.08; P < .001). When ND was defined using tau and ptau,  individuals with stage 2+ had accelerated Aβ accumulation relative to stage 0  (t = 4.96) and SNAP (t = 4.06), and those with stage 1 had accelerated Aβ  accumulation relative to stage 0 (t = 8.44) and SNAP (t = 6.61) (P < .001 for all  comparisons). When ND was defined using cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, individuals  with stage 2+ had accelerated hippocampal atrophy relative to stage 0 (t = -3.41;  P < .001), stage 1 (t = -2.48; P = .03), and SNAP (t = -2.26; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS  AND RELEVANCE: More advanced preclinical stages of AD have greater longitudinal Aβ  accumulation. SNAP appears most likely to capture inherent individual variability in  brain structure or to represent comorbid pathologic features rather than early  emerging AD. Low hippocampal volumes or elevated levels of tau or ptau in isolation  may not accurately represent ongoing neurodegenerative processes.","2016-10-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1192-1200","","10","73","","JAMA Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27548756  PMCID: PMC5237381","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Biomarkers; Positron-Emission Tomography; tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid; Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism; *Disease Progression; Prodromal Symptoms; Aniline Compounds; Alzheimer Disease/classification/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism; Hippocampus/*diagnostic imaging; Thiazoles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two self-reported questions about sleep quality and duration were examined. Successful aging was defined following Rowe and Kahn's multidimensional model. To assess the adjusted association between sleep and successful aging, multivariable logistic regression was applied.Results: The average number of self-reported hours of sleep was 6.2 ± 2.0 among older Chinese people. Successful aging was related to sleep duration, with the proportion of those adults considered to be aging successfully falling into the following sleep duration categories (<6 h - 7.8%; 6 h - 16.3%; 7 h - 19.1%; 8 h - 14.7%; and ≥9 h - 12.8%). The plots between sleep duration and successful aging were an inverse U-shape. Participants who slept less than 6 h per day had lower odds ratios of successful aging [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.67] relative to those who slept for 7 h per day. Compared with those who reported poor sleep less than once a week, older people who reported poor sleep five to seven days a week showed a lower ratio of successful aging (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.39).Conclusion: Older age, shorter or longer sleep, and poor sleep were related to lower odds of, rates of successful aging.

Successful aging has long been a goal in the field of gerontology. The present study aimed to evaluate  successful aging among Chinese older adults. METHODS: Data on a total of 7102 people  in the China Health and Retirement Study aged ≥60 years were analyzed in the present  study. Successful aging is defined by the model of Rowe and Kahn including the  following five indicators: ""no major diseases,"" ""no disability,"" ""high cognitive  functioning,"" ""high physical functioning"" and ""active engagement with life."" Using  logistic regression analysis, crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence  intervals were calculated to evaluate the relationship between sociodemographic  parameters and successful aging. RESULTS: The prevalence of successful aging was  13.2% among Chinese older people. The percentage of older people with the five  indicators, ""no major diseases,"" ""no disability,"" ""high cognitive functioning,""  ""high physical functioning,"" and ""active engagement with life"" was 41.7%, 92.1%,  54.2%, 70.2% and 46.0%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed people who  had received education of high/vocational school or above had significantly greater  odds of successful aging compared with those with less than primary school education  (P < 0.05). The effect of education to college level or above on cognitive  functioning was 2.51-fold higher in women than men (P = 0.006). Older people from a  non-agricultural Hukou had 1.85-fold higher odds of successful aging than those from  an agricultural Hukou. Older people living in the central, northeast or western  regions had lower odds of successful aging relative to those living in the east  coast region (0.72, 0.72 and 0.56, respectively).

Multiple logistic regression was applied to investigate  the association of depression, psychotropic medication use, and mental illness,  separately, with cardiovascular disease. The results suggested that cardiovascular  disease was significantly associated with various definitions of depression,  including: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) ≥ 16,  self-reported, and physician-diagnosed for depression (adjusted odds ratio  [AOR] = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.00 for CES-D; AOR = 3.29; 95% CI:  1.99-5.42 for self-reported; and AOR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.51-3.97 for  physician-diagnosed). Additionally, significant associations of cardiovascular  disease with the use of antipsychotics (AOR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.25-3.34),  benzodiazepines (BZDs) (AOR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.52-2.21), and Z-drugs (AOR = 1.41; 95%  CI: 1.03-1.93), respectively, were also observed, but not the use of  antidepressants. In addition, a significant association of cardiovascular disease  with mental illness was found in this study (AOR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.68-3.24). In line  with previous reports, these findings provided supportive evidence that depression  and/or mental illness were significantly associated with cardiovascular disease in a  community-dwelling elderly population in Taiwan. Moreover, significant associations  of cardiovascular disease with the use of antipsychotics, BZDs, and Z-drugs,  individually, were found.

Protein distribution across meals was calculated as the CV of protein ingested per meal, with lower values reflecting evenness of protein intake. Linear mixed-model analysis was performed to examine changes in LM and aLM across time, by sex, as conditioned by the quantity and distribution of protein intake, adjusted for potential covariates. Results: Over 2 y, LM declined in both men (-2.5% ± 4.0%) and women (-2.0% ± 3.4%) (P < 0.05), whereas aLM loss was not significant (men: -1.5% ± 4.8%; women: 21.2% ± 5.3%; P > 0.05). The decline in LM was not independently affected by the quantity and distribution of protein intake. Yet men and women with evenly distributed protein intakes and men with high protein intakes showed higher LM or aLM throughout the entire follow-up period, even after potential confounders were controlled for (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that greater protein intakes and a more even distribution across meals are modifiable factors associated with higher muscle mass in older adults but not with losses over 2 y. Interventional studies should determine longer-term effects on preserving LM with aging.","2016-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:06:48","","694-703","","3","104","","Am J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 27465379","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Abridged Index Medicus; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet Records; Geriatric Assessment; Sex Factors; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Feeding Behavior; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; Scales; aging; sarcopenia; Self Report; *aging; Quebec/epidemiology; Disease Progression; Chronic Disease; *elderly; *Feeding Behavior; nutrition; Body Weights and Measures; *nutrition; Quebec; Patient Compliance; *Meals; dietary protein; *Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Diet, Healthy; elderly; *dietary protein; *lean mass; *muscle mass; *sarcopenia; Absorptiometry, Photon; Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic; Diet/*adverse effects; Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use; Sarcopenia/epidemiology/*physiopathology/prevention & control; muscle mass; Quebec -- epidemiology; Sarcopenia; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Dietary Proteins; Diet -- adverse effects; Dietary Proteins -- administration & dosage; Dietary Proteins -- therapeutic use; lean mass; Meals; Sarcopenia -- epidemiology; Sarcopenia -- physiopathology; Sarcopenia -- prevention & control; Questionnaires; Analysis of Covariance; Community Living; Summated Rating Scaling; Random Sample; Secondary Analysis; Physical Activity; Data Analysis Software; Nutritional Assessment; Body Composition -- In Old Age; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Food Intake -- In Old Age; Mann-Whitney U Test; Urban Areas; Geriatric Nutrition; Structured Interview; Muscle, Skeletal -- Metabolism; Crossover Design; Dietary Proteins -- Metabolism -- In Old Age; Fat Free Mass -- Metabolism; Friedman Test; Meals -- In Old Age; Portion Size; Suburban Areas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous cross-sectional studies demonstrated increasing T1 values in white and decreasing T1 values in grey matter over the lifetime. However, these findings have not yet been confirmed on the basis of a longitudinal study. In this longitudinal study over 7 years, T1 relaxometry was used to investigate the dynamics of age-related microstructural changes in older healthy subjects.Methods: T1 mapping was performed in 17 healthy subjects (range 51-77 years) at baseline and after 7 years. Advanced cortical and white matter segmentation was used to determine mean T1 values in the cortex and white matter.Results: The analysis revealed a decrease of mean cortical T1 values over 7 years, the rate of T1 reduction being more prominent in subjects with higher age. T1 decreases were predominantly localized in the lateral frontal, parietal and temporal cortex. In contrast, mean white matter T1 values remained stable.Conclusions: T1 mapping is shown to be sensitive to age-related microstructural changes in healthy ageing subjects in a longitudinal setting. Data of a cohort in late adulthood and the senescence period demonstrate a decrease of cortical T1 values over 7 years, most likely reflecting decreasing water content and increased iron concentrations.Key Points: • T1 mapping is sensitive to age-related microstructural changes in a longitudinal setting. • T1 decreases were predominantly localized in the lateral frontal, parietal and temporal cortex. • The rate of T1 reduction was more prominent in subjects with higher age. • These changes most likely reflect decreasing cortical water and increasing iron concentrations.","2017-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:54:46","","1568-1576","","4","27","","Eur Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 27379992","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Brain -- Pathology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Brain; *Ageing; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Brain Mapping/*methods; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; *Cerebral cortex; *Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging; *T1 relaxation; *White matter; Aging/pathology/*physiology; Brain/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Gray Matter/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Iron/analysis; Temporal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/pathology; White Matter/diagnostic imaging/pathology; Middle Age; Gray Matter -- Pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Temporal Lobe; Temporal Lobe -- Pathology; Brain Mapping -- Methods; Gray Matter; Image Processing, Computer Assisted -- Methods; Iron -- Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Anticipatory, pre-swallow motor movements  may be critical to safe and efficient eating/swallowing, particularly for older  adults. However, the nature of these responses is relatively unknown. This study  compared the magnitude of anticipatory mouth opening during eating in healthy older  (aged 70-85) and younger (aged 18-30) adults under four eating conditions: typical  self-feeding, typical assisted feeding (being fed by a research assistant resulting  in proprioceptive loss), sensory loss self-feeding (wearing blindfold/headphones  resulting in exteroceptive loss) and sensory loss assisted feeding (proprioceptive  and exteroceptive loss). Older adults opened their mouths wider than younger adults  in anticipation of food intake under both typical and most non-oropharyngeal sensory  loss conditions. Further, the loss of proprioceptive and exteroceptive cues resulted  in decreased anticipatory mouth opening for all participants. Greater mouth opening  in older adults may be a protective compensation, contributing to the preservation  of function associated with healthy ageing. Our finding that the loss of  non-oropharyngeal sensory cues resulted in decreased anticipatory mouth opening  highlights how important proprioception, vision, and hearing are in pre-swallow  behaviour. Age- and disease-related changes in vision, hearing, and the ability to  self-feed may reduce the effectiveness of these pre-swallow strategies.","2016-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","662-669","","9","43","","J Oral Rehabil","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","","","","PMID: 27377757  PMCID: PMC4980237","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Healthy Volunteers; Aging/*physiology; *Movement; aged; deglutition; deglutition disorders; Deglutition/physiology; eating; Eating/*physiology/*psychology; Evoked Potentials/physiology; motor activity; Mouth/*innervation/*physiology; oropharynx; Oropharynx/physiology; Sensory Thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Derivation and  validation analysis in a prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two academic medical  centers. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 70 and older enrolled in the Successful  Aging after Elective Surgery Study undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery (N =  566). MEASUREMENTS: The sample was randomly divided into a derivation dataset (n =  377) and an independent validation dataset (n = 189). These datasets were used to  develop a severity scoring method using the 3D-CAM based on the four-item CAM-S SF  (3D-CAM-S) and evaluate agreement between the 3D-CAM-S and the traditional CAM-S SF  using weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS: A method for scoring severity using 3D-CAM  items was developed that achieved good agreement with the CAM-S SF in the derivation  dataset (κ = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-0.95). The 3D-CAM-S achieved  nearly identical agreement in the independent validation dataset (κ = 0.93, 95% CI =  0.92-0.95), and 100% of 3D-CAM-S scores were within 1 point of the CAM-S SF score in  both datasets. The 3D-CAM-S also strongly predicts clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: A  newly developed method for scoring delirium severity using the 3D-CAM (the 3D-CAM-S)  has excellent agreement with the CAM-S SF. This new methodology enables clinicians  and researchers using the 3D-CAM for surveillance to measure delirium severity and  monitor its course simultaneously by tracking changes over time. The 3D-CAM-S  expands the utility of the 3D-CAM as an important tool for delirium recognition and  management.","2016-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:29:02","","1684-1689","","8","64","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","© 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.","","","","","","PMID: 27374833  PMCID: PMC4988867","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Algorithms; *delirium; Elective Surgical Procedures; delirium; *Confusion Assessment Method; *delirium severity; *Interview, Psychological; Confusion/*classification/*diagnosis; Delirium/*classification/*diagnosis; Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/psychology; Psychometrics/*statistics & numerical data; Symptom Assessment/*methods/psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Postoperative Complications -- epidemiology; Confusion -- classification; Confusion -- diagnosis; Confusion Assessment Method; Delirium -- classification; Delirium -- diagnosis; delirium severity; Interview, Psychological; Postoperative Complications -- diagnosis; Postoperative Complications -- psychology; Psychometrics -- statistics & numerical data; Symptom Assessment -- methods; Symptom Assessment -- psychology; Symptom Assessment -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Baseline assessments included a  researcher-administered questionnaire, physical examination, and laboratory testing.  A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with SA.  RESULTS: The prevalence of SA was 38.81% in the CLHLS in 2012.

METHODS: A total of 37 participants  between the ages of 49 and 87 years old were scanned with a 3 Tesla system, using  T(1)-weighted, T(2) weighted and quantitative spin-echo T(2) imaging. Contrast  between image intensities and T(2) values was calculated for various regions,  including between individual hippocampal subfields. RESULTS: The T(1)  contrast-to-noise (CNR) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (GWR) did not change  in the hippocampus, but it declined in the cingulate cortex with age. In contrast,  T(2) CNR and GWR declined in both brain regions. T(2) relaxation time was almost  constant in gray matter and most (but not all) hippocampal subfields, but increased  substantially in white matter, pointing to an age effect on water relaxation in  white matter. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in T(1) and T(2) MR characteristics influence the  appearance of brain images in later life and should be considered in image analyses  of aged subjects. It is speculated that alterations at the cell biology level, with  concomitant alterations to the local magnetic environment, reduce dephasing and  subsequently prolong spin-echo T(2) through reduced diffusion effects in later life.","2016-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","833-842","","6","29","","MAGMA","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27333937  PMCID: PMC5124042","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; *Aging; Brain; White Matter/diagnostic imaging; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; White matter; *Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Contrast Media; Contrast-to-noise ratio; Dephasing; Gray matter; Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; T2 relaxation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As Alzheimer's disease is characterized by multiple  pathological changes, a biomarker panel reflecting co-occurring pathology will  likely be most useful for early detection. Towards this end, 175 late middle-aged  participants (mean age 55.9 ± 5.7 years at first cognitive assessment, 70% female)  were recruited from two longitudinally followed cohorts to undergo magnetic  resonance imaging and lumbar puncture. Cluster analysis was used to group  individuals based on biomarkers of amyloid pathology (cerebrospinal fluid  amyloid-β42/amyloid-β40 assay levels), magnetic resonance imaging-derived measures  of neurodegeneration/atrophy (cerebrospinal fluid-to-brain volume ratio, and  hippocampal volume), neurofibrillary tangles (cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated  tau181 assay levels), and a brain-based marker of vascular risk (total white matter  hyperintensity lesion volume). Four biomarker clusters emerged consistent with  preclinical features of (i) Alzheimer's disease; (ii) mixed Alzheimer's disease and  vascular aetiology; (iii) suspected non-Alzheimer's disease aetiology; and (iv)  healthy ageing. Cognitive decline was then analysed between clusters using  longitudinal assessments of episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function,  and global cognitive function with linear mixed effects modelling. Cluster 1  exhibited a higher intercept and greater rates of decline on tests of episodic  memory. Cluster 2 had a lower intercept on a test of semantic memory and both  Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 had steeper rates of decline on a test of global cognition.  Additional analyses on Cluster 3, which had the smallest hippocampal volume, suggest  that its biomarker profile is more likely due to hippocampal vulnerability and not  to detectable specific volume loss exceeding the rate of normal ageing. Our results  demonstrate that pathology, as indicated by biomarkers, in a preclinical timeframe  is related to patterns of longitudinal cognitive decline. Such biomarker patterns  may be useful for identifying at-risk populations to recruit for clinical trials.","2016-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:56:52","","2261-2274","","Pt 8","139","","Brain","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author (2016).

Longitudinal data  were from the 1921-1926 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's  Health (n 11 119), over 18 years of follow-up. Self-rated health status was measured  at each survey, and BMI was measured at baseline. Multi-state models were fitted to  estimate the effect of BMI on total life expectancy (TLE) and HLE. Compared with  women of normal weight, overweight women at the age of 75 years had similar TLE but  fewer years healthy (-0·79; 95 % CI -1·21, -0·37) and more years unhealthy (0·99; 95  % CI 0·56, 1·42). Obese women at the age of 75 years lived fewer years in total than  normal-weight women (-1·09; 95 % CI -1·77, -0·41), and had more unhealthy years  (1·46; 95 % CI 0·97, 1·95 years). Underweight women had the lowest TLE and the  fewest years of healthy life. Women should aim to enter old age at a normal weight  and in good health, as the slight benefit on mortality of being overweight is offset  by spending fewer years healthy. All outcomes were better for those who began in  good health. The relationship between weight and HLE has important implications for  nutrition for older people, particularly maintenance of lean body mass and  prevention of obesity. The benefit of weight loss in obese older women remains  unclear, but we support the recommendation that weight-loss advice be  individualised, as any benefits may not outweigh the risks in healthy obese older  adults.","2016-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","692-699","","4","116","","Br J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27307012","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Australia; *Healthy ageing; *Mortality; *Health Status; *Body Mass Index; *Life Expectancy; *BMI; *HLE healthy life expectancy; *Older persons; *TLE total life expectancy; *UHLE unhealthy life expectancy; Overweight/*mortality; Thinness/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the association between adherence to French food-based and nutrient-based guidelines at midlife, as assessed by three dietary scores, and HA. HA was assessed in 2007–2009, among 2329 participants of the SUpplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux AntioXydants study aged 45–60 years at baseline (1994–1995) and initially free of diabetes, CVD and cancer. HA was defined as not developing any major chronic disease, good physical and cognitive functioning, no limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no depressive symptoms, no health-related limitations in social life, good overall self-perceived health and no function-limiting pain. Data from repeated 24-h dietary records provided at baseline permitted the computation of the modified French Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score (mPNNS-GS), the Probability of Adequate Nutrient Intake Dietary Score (PANDiet) and the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I). Associations of these scores with HA were assessed by logistic regression. In 2007–2009, 42 % of men and 36 % of women met our criteria of HA. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher scores of the mPNNS-GS (ORquartile 4 v. quartile 1 1·44; 95 % CI 1·10, 1·87; Ptrend=0·006) and the PANDiet (1·28; 95 % CI 1·00, 1·64; Ptrend=0·03) were associated with higher odds of HA. We observed no association between DQI-I and HA.

Hazard ratios for Δage (per 5  years) calculated using the epigenetic clock developed by Horvath were 1.23 (95 % CI  1.10-1.38) for all-cause mortality, 1.22 (95 % CI 1.03-1.45) for cancer mortality,  and 1.19 (95 % CI 0.98-1.43) for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for batch  effects, age, sex, educational level, history of chronic diseases, hypertension,  smoking status, body mass index, and leucocyte distribution. Associations were  similar but weaker for Δage calculated using the epigenetic clock developed by  Hannum. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that age acceleration in terms of the  difference between age predicted by DNA methylation and chronological age is an  independent predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and may be useful as  a general marker of healthy aging.","2016","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:53:36","","64","","","8","","Clin Epigenetics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27274774  PMCID: PMC4891876","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Aging -- genetics; Cardiovascular Diseases -- genetics; Mortality; Leukocyte Count; Proportional Hazards Models; Cause of Death; Mortality risk; *Epigenesis, Genetic; Aging/*genetics; Epigenetic clock; Blood/metabolism; Cardiovascular Diseases/*genetics; DNA methylation age; Epigenetic age acceleration; Neoplasms/*genetics; Epigenesis, Genetic; Blood -- metabolism; Neoplasms -- genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to determine trajectories of decline in a large cohort by disease status, and examined their correspondence with biomarkers of ageing processes including growth hormone, sex steroid, inflammation, visceral adiposity and kidney function pathways.Methods: We have followed the 5888 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) for healthy ageing and longevity since 1989-90. Gait speed, grip strength, modified mini-mental status examination (3MSE) and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) were assessed annually to 1998-99 and again in 2005-06. Insulin-like growth hormone (IGF-1), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin and cystatin-C were assessed 3-5 times from stored samples. Health status was updated annually and dichotomized as healthy vs not healthy. Trajectories for each function measure and biomarker were estimated using generalized estimating equations as a function of age and health status using standardized values.Results: Trajectories of functional decline showed strong age acceleration late in life in healthy older men and women as well as in chronically ill older adults. Adiponectin, IL-6 and cystatin-C tracked with functional decline in all domains; cystatin-C was consistently associated with functional declines independent of other biomarkers. DHEAS was independently associated with grip strength and IL-6 with grip strength and gait speed trajectories.Conclusions: Functional decline in late life appears to mark a fundamental ageing process in that it occurred and was accelerated in late life regardless of health status. Cystatin C was most consistently associated with these functional declines.","2016-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:25:18","","1135-1145","","4","45","","Int J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016; all rights reserved.

Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire. Successful aging status was determined through interviewer-administered questionnaire at each visit and was defined as the absence of disability, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms, and chronic diseases (eg, cancer and coronary artery disease).Results: In all, 249 (15.5%) participants had aged successfully 10 years later. Dietary GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake were not significantly associated with successful aging. However, participants in the highest versus lowest (reference group) quartile of total fiber intake had greater odds of aging successfully than suboptimal aging, multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-2.84). Those who remained consistently below the median in consumption of fiber from breads/cereal and fruit compared with the rest of cohort were less likely to age successfully, OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.84) and OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.44-0.95), respectively.Conclusions: Consumption of dietary fiber from breads/cereals and fruits independently influenced the likelihood of aging successfully over 10 years. These findings suggest that increasing intake of fiber-rich foods could be a successful strategy in reaching old age disease free and fully functional.","2016-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:39:20","","1335-1340","","10","71","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

A person-centered approach among older adults in Taiwan.","Geriatrics & gerontology international","","1447-0594","10.1111/ggi.12774","","AIM: The present study aimed to identify the health profiles of older adults by using latent class analysis to investigate health heterogeneity and to determine  what factors predicted healthy aging among an oldest-old sample cohort that was  followed up for 14 years in Taiwan. METHODS: Data were drawn from five waves  (carried out in 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007) of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on  Aging to examine the changes in health heterogeneity in a nationally representative  oldest-old cohort of Taiwanese. Overall, data from a total of 11 145 observations of  3155 older adults were considered. The influential factors predicting health changes  were analyzed by using a generalized estimating equation. RESULTS: The results  showed that four health profiles were identified among the aging population observed  in the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. With increasing age, the combined effects  of the physical functioning, cognitive and emotional health, and comorbidities of  older adults significantly impact their health changes. Apart from health  deteriorating with age and sex disparities, educational and economic status, health  behaviors, and social participation at the individual level were found to be the  robust factors in predicting healthy aging. CONCLUSIONS: In considering what factors  impact healthy aging, we suggest that a person-centered approach would be useful and  critical for policy makers to understand the compositions of health profiles and the  influencing factors in view of a life-course perspective. Based on the factors  identified as influencing healthy aging at the individual level, it is imperative  from a policy-making perspective to maximize opportunities for healthy aging.

METHODS: We  employed 16-year longitudinal data from 2095 participants aged 55-85 years at  baseline in the Dutch, nationally representative Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam.  For 9 indicators of successful ageing, separate Latent Class Growth models were used  to identify subgroups of older adults with a 'successful' trajectory. A 'Successful  Aging Index' expressed the number of indicators for which individual respondents had  a successful trajectory (range 0-9). Using multivariate regression models, we  investigated associations between socioeconomic position and the Successful Ageing  Index, and with separate indicators of successful ageing. RESULTS: Higher education,  occupational skill level and income were independently associated with higher  numbers of successful trajectories. Education (β=0.09) was a slightly stronger  correlate of successful ageing than income (β=0.08). Analyses of separate indicators  of successful ageing showed that cognitive functioning, functional limitations and  emotional support given were associated with all three components of socioeconomic  position, while other indicators were associated with only one (eg, life  satisfaction) or none (eg, social loneliness). For some indicators of successful  ageing, socioeconomic inequalities were present at baseline, and also increased or  decreased during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Education, occupation and income represent  distinct socioeconomic life course factors, each of which contribute in a specific  way to inequalities in successful ageing. Physical and cognitive functioning were  associated more strongly with socioeconomic position than social and emotional  functioning.","2016-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1106-1113","","11","70","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","eng","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We aimed to identify blood-based postoperative delirium markers in a nested  case-control study of older surgical patients using a proteomics approach followed  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation. METHODS: The Successful  Aging after Elective Surgery study enrolled dementia-free adults ≥70 years old  undergoing major scheduled noncardiac surgery (N = 566; 24% delirium). Plasma was  collected at four time points: preoperative, postanesthesia care unit, postoperative  day 2, and 1 month postoperative. Matched pairs were selected for the independent  discovery (39 pairs) and replication cohorts (36 pairs), which were subsequently  combined into the pooled cohort (75 pairs). Isobaric tags for relative and absolute  quantitation-based relative quantitation mass spectrometry proteomics were performed  to identify the strongest delirium-related protein, which was selected for ELISA  validation. Using the ELISA results, statistical analyses using nonparametric signed  rank tests were performed in all cohorts examining the association between the  identified protein and delirium. RESULTS: C-reactive protein emerged from the  proteomics analysis as the strongest delirium-related protein. Validation by ELISA  confirmed that compared with controls, cases had significantly higher C-reactive  protein levels in the discovery, replication, and pooled cohorts at the preoperative  (median paired difference [MPD] 1.97 mg/L [p < .05], 0.29 mg/L, 1.56 mg/L [p <  .01]), postanesthesia care unit (MPD 2.83 mg/L, 2.22 mg/L [p < .05], 2.53 mg/L [p <  .01]) and postoperative day 2 (MPD 71.97 mg/L [p < .01], 35.18 mg/L [p < .05], 63.76  mg/L [p < .01]) time points, but not 1 month postoperative (MPD 2.72 mg/L, -0.66  mg/L, 1.10 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated preoperative and postoperative plasma levels  of C-reactive protein were associated with delirium, suggesting that a  preinflammatory state and heightened inflammatory response to surgery are potential  pathophysiologic mechanisms of delirium.","2017-01-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","145-153","","2","81","","Biol Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

However, few studies have considered older adults' daily mobility to better understand how local built and social environments may contribute to healthy aging. Meanwhile, wearable sensors and interactive map-based applications offer novel means for gathering information on people's mobility, levels of physical activity, or social network structure. Combining such data with classical questionnaires on well-being, physical activity, perceived environments and qualitative assessment of experience of places opens new opportunities to assess the complex interplay between individuals and environments. In line with current gaps and novel analytical capabilities, this research proposes an international research agenda to collect and analyse detailed data on daily mobility, social networks and health outcomes among older adults using interactive web-based questionnaires and wearable sensors.Methods/design: Our study resorts to a battery of innovative data collection methods including use of a novel multisensor device for collection of location and physical activity, interactive map-based questionnaires on regular destinations and social networks, and qualitative assessment of experience of places. This rich data will allow advanced quantitative and qualitative analyses in the aim to disentangle the complex people-environment interactions linking urban local contexts to healthy aging, with a focus on active living, social networks and participation, and well-being.Discussion: This project will generate evidence about what characteristics of urban environments relate to active mobility, social participation, and well-being, three important dimensions of healthy aging. It also sets the basis for an international research agenda on built environment and healthy aging based on a shared and comprehensive data collection protocol.","2016-05-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:23:34","","96","","","16","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 27151297  PMCID: PMC4858908","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Social Environment; Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Urban Population; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Healthy aging; Aging/*psychology; Environment; *Urban Population; Physical activity; *Environment Design; Social Participation/*psychology; *Geographic Information Systems/instrumentation; *Internationality; Comprehension; Daily mobility; GIS; Mixed methods; Social networks; Social participation; Spatial epidemiology; Wearable sensors; Environment Design; Social Participation -- psychology; Geographic Information Systems -- instrumentation; Internationality; Readability; International Relations; Social Participation -- Psychosocial Factors; Geographic Information Systems -- Equipment and Supplies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVES:  Alternative pathways linking SES to DQ, DS, and CA were tested and models compared,  stratified by race and sex. METHODS: With the use of data from the Healthy Aging in  Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (baseline age: 30-64 y; 2 visits;  mean follow-up: 4.9 y), 12 structural equation models (SM) were conducted and  compared. Time-dependent factors included the Center for Epidemiologic  Studies-Depression [CES-D total score, baseline or visit 1 (v1), follow-up or visit  2 (v2), mean across visits (m), and annual rate of change (Δ)], 2010 Healthy Eating  Index (HEI) (same notation), and central adiposity principal components' analysis  score of waist circumference and trunk fat (kg) (Adipcent) (same notation). Sample  sizes were white women (WW, n = 236), white men (WM, n = 159), African American  women (AAW, n = 395), and African American men (AAM, n = 274), and a multigroup  analysis within the SM framework was also conducted. RESULTS: In the best-fitting  model, overall, ∼31% of the total effect of SES→Adipcent(v2) (α ± SE: -0.10 ± 0.03,  P < 0.05) was mediated through a combination of CES-D(v1) and ΔHEI. Two dominant  pathways contributed to the indirect effect: SES→(-)CES-D(v1)→(+)Adipcent(v2)  (-0.015) and SES→(+) ΔHEI→(-)Adipcent(v2) (-0.017), with a total indirect effect of  -0.031 (P < 0.05). In a second best-fitting model, SES independently predicted  Adipcent(v1, -0.069), ΔHEI(+0.037) and CES-D(v2, -2.70) (P < 0.05), with  Adipcent(v1) marginally predicting ΔHEI(-0.014) and CES-D(v2, +0.67) (P < 0.10).  These findings were indicative of DS's and CA's marginally significant bidirectional  association (P < 0.10). Although best-fit-selected models were consistent across  race × sex categories, path coefficients differed significantly between groups.  Specifically, SES→Adipcent[v1(+0.11), v2(+0.14)] was positive among AAM (P < 0.05),  and the overall positive association of Adipcent(v1)→CES-D(v2) was specific to AAW  (+0.97, P < 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Despite consistent model fit, pathways linking SES  to DQ, DS, and CA differed markedly among the race × sex groups.

This is particularly  important for women, who are heavily dependent on social relationships and are more  influenced by social losses and change. OBJECTIVE: To examine major social changes  occurring in the decade prior to late-life, starting from approximately 45-55 years  of age. STUDY DESIGN: The study accessed data from the longitudinal prospective  Women's Healthy Ageing Project (WHAP). Participants were 493 women who had completed  at least one assessment in the first 12 years of the study. RESULTS: Living with a  partner was common and stable amongst participants, while the proportion with  children still at home decreased markedly (79-44%). Full-time employment also  decreased as participants approached the average retirement age (40-13%). Volunteer  work was popular throughout the study, increasing slightly with age, and minding  grandchildren was common at the end of the study period (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Taken  together, these findings suggest a notable deficit in participants' social lives as  they transition into later life, but with some evidence of compensation by  increasing other social activities.","2016-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:23:03","","90-95","","","88","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We drew the phenotype's trajectories and tested whether their levels and rates of change are influenced by health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions earlier in the life course.Design and Outcomes: The English Longitudinal Ageing Study, a prospective, nationally representative sample of people aged ≥50 years, measured a set of eight biomarkers which make up the outcome of the healthy ageing phenotype three times over nearly a decade (N2004=5009, N2008=5301, N2013=4455). A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype's distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.Results: Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by -0.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.352, -0.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by -0.293 (CI: -0.403, -0.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.Conclusion: Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.","2016-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:24:42","","9-15","","","88","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 The Author.

In a birth cohort born  between 1930 and 1932 we investigated the influence of DM Type II and disease  duration on neuropsychological functioning (memory/learning, attention, verbal  fluency, visuospatial thinking and abstract thinking) across 14 years. Subjects who  developed MCI or AD performed significantly poorer on all neuropsychological tests  applied.

Additionally, in visuospatial thinking this change  was more pronounced for individuals suffering from MCI/AD. We found that, as a  concomitant disease DM Type II does not affect memory functioning, which is  typically compromised in MCI and early AD. Rather, it may lead to deficits in  cognitive flexibility and visuospatial thinking. DM Type II can be considered a  frequent comorbid condition which can aggravate the course of MCI and AD.

We  aimed to study the association between seven-day objectively measured habitual PA,  chronic stress and leukocyte telomere length. METHODS: Study participants were  African (N.=96) and Caucasian (N.=107) school teachers of the Sympathetic activity  and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Africans study. All lifestyle characteristics  (including PA) were objectively measured. The general health questionnaire and serum  cortisol were assessed as psychological and physical measures of chronic stress.  Leukocyte telomere length was measured using the quantitative real-time polymerase  chain reaction. RESULTS: Africans had significantly shorter telomeres (P<.0001) and  greater psychological distress (P=0.001) than Caucasians, whereas no group  difference was seen for cortisol levels. Higher age (ß=-0.28 [-0.40, -0.16,  P≤0.000), higher alcohol consumption (ß=-0.21 [-0.36, -0.08], P=0.003) and increased  central obesity (ß=-0.17 [-0.30, -0.03], P=0.017) were all significantly associated  with shorter telomeres. Habitual PA of different intensity was not significantly  associated with markers of chronic stress or telomere length. However, more time  spent with light intensity PA time was significantly and independently correlated  with lower waist circumference (r=-0.21, P=0.004); in turn, greater waist  circumference was significantly associated shorter telomeres (β=-0.17 [-0.30,  -0.03], P=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Habitual PA of different intensity was not directly  associated with markers of chronic stress and leukocyte telomere length in this  biethnic cohort.

More importantly, such  information might be critical to predict those mild cognitive impairment (MCI)  patients at a higher risk of conversion to AD. Usually, follow-up studies utilize a  reduced number of potential markers although the conversion phenomenon may be deemed  as multifactorial in essence. In addition, not only biological but also cognitive  markers may play an important role. Considering this background, we investigated the  role of cognitive reserve, cognitive performance in neuropsychological testing,  hippocampal volumes, APOE genotype, and magnetoencephalography power sources to  predict the conversion to AD in a sample of 33 MCI patients. MCIs were followed up  during a 2-year period and divided into two subgroups according to their outcome:  The ""stable"" MCI group (sMCI, 21 subjects) and the ""progressive"" MCI group (pMCI, 12  subjects). Baseline multifactorial information was submitted to a hierarchical  logistic regression analysis to build a predictive model of conversion to AD.  Results indicated that the combination of left hippocampal volume, occipital cortex  theta power, and clock drawing copy subtest scores predicted conversion to AD with a  100% of sensitivity and 94.7% of specificity. According to these results it might be  suggested that anatomical, cognitive, and neurophysiological markers may be  considered as ""first order"" predictors of progression to AD, while APOE or cognitive  reserve proxies might play a more secondary role.","2016-03-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","133-143","","1","52","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 27060953","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Mental Status Schedule; Neuropsychological Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Logistic Models; Prognosis; Multivariate Analysis; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; Alzheimer’s disease; Disease Progression; Magnetoencephalography; Organ Size; Brain/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/genetics/physiopathology; APOE; Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/genetics/physiopathology; cognitive reserve; Cognitive Reserve; hippocampal volume; magnetoencephalography; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychological tests; predictive model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Those aged ≥65 years from  the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) were included in this cross sectional  analysis. Three logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships  between 25 health, psychological and sociodemographic variables and difficulties in  ADL, IADL and ADL/IADL combined. RESULTS: The proportion of those reporting combined  ADL/IADL difficulties was 18%. More individuals reported difficulty with ADLs (13%)  than IADLS (11%). The main model showed that after age, the top three factors  associated with difficulty in ADL/IADL combined were pain, taking five or more  medications and depression. After age, the factors with the highest impact on ADL  disability were pain, taking five or more medications and body mass index (BMI); the  factors with the highest impact on IADL were being separated or divorced, living  with others (non-spouse) and self-rated memory. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of  sociodemographics and early interventions for pain and cognitive deficits could  reduce ADL/IADL disability and promote successful ageing. Identification of  variables that influence ADL/IADLs can be used to inform policy and practice.  Implications for rehabilitation After age, pain and taking five or more medications  were the strongest factors associated with difficulty in ADL/IADL combined and ADL  alone. Practice therefore needs to be cognizant that it is not the disease label but  the symptoms of a disease that affect ADL and IADL activities. Given the strong  influence of pain on difficulties with ADL and IADL, there is a need for early  interventions from a multidisciplinary perspective for pain reduction, control, and  self-management. These interventions should include development of pain-coping  strategies and exercises to maintain mobility. After age, being separated/divorced  or living with non-spouse others are the strongest factors associated with IADL  difficulties. Awareness of these social factors can be used to inform support  mechanisms, such as development of community services and suitable housing for those  with these changing sociodemographics. Unsurprisingly, cognitive impairments were  strongly associated with IADL difficulties. Simple cognitive screening assessments  could be used for early detection of cognitive changes. In order to maintain optimal  cognitive functioning, rehabilitation professionals should facilitate older adults'  engagement in activities that are cognitively demanding and socially interactive.","2017-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:57:10","","809-816","","8","39","","Disabil Rehabil","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 27045728","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Analysis of Variance; Age Factors; Multivariate Analysis; Ireland; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; Scales; *older adults; *Independent Living; *Geriatric Assessment; *Activities of Daily Living; *Activities of daily living; Depression/epidemiology; *Disability Evaluation; Marital Status; Depression; Pain Measurement; Polypharmacy; *instrumental activities of daily living; Cognition Disorders/epidemiology; *predictors; *the Irish longitudinal study of aging (TILDA); Ireland/epidemiology; Cognition Disorders; Questionnaires; Community Living; Interviews; Bivariate Statistics; Data Analysis Software; Effect Size; Post Hoc Analysis; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Logistic Regression; Pain; Power Analysis; Stratified Random Sample; Bathing and Baths; Disabled -- In Old Age -- Ireland; Divorce; Dressing; Early Intervention; Activities of Daily Living -- In Old Age; Chronic Pain; Community Living -- In Old Age -- Ireland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Healthy Habits Program (HHP) was implemented to provide a community-based physical  activity and education intervention for Chinese older adults living in Boston,  Massachusetts. This study evaluated the HHP by assessing outcomes that are critical  for maintaining independence of older persons. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:  Quantitative evaluation was performed on 50 Chinese older adults enrolled in the  HHP. The community members were trained in data collection and management.  MEASUREMENTS: Cognition (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail Making Test and  Complex Walking Task), mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and  maximal gait speed), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), perceived  disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment 2.0), nutritional status  (Mini Nutrition Assessment®), and strength (grip and leg strength) were assessed at  baseline and at 6 months. All tests were translated into Chinese. RESULTS: Of the 50  participants (mean age 68.4 years; 68% female), 78% achieved the goal of performing  exercise ≥3 times/week. After 6 months, clinically meaningful improvements were  observed in mobility (mean SPPB score changed from 10.3 to 11.1 points; p=0.01) and  cognition (mean MMSE score changed from 26.0 to 27.8 points; p=0.001). There were  also statistically significant improvements in executive function, depressive  symptoms and perceived disability (p<0.05).

Risk  factors of cognitive impairment were assessed using the ordinal logistic regression  (OLR). RESULT: The prevalence of SA, UA and MCI in this study was 11, 73 and 16 %  respectively. OLR indicated that higher fasting blood sugar, hyperlipidemia,  disability, lower education level, not regularly involved in technical based  activities, limited use of modern technologies, lower intake of fruits and fresh  fruit juices and not practicing calorie restriction were among the risk factors of  poor cognitive performance in this study.

Various SA measures  have been proposed but no consensus has been reached and many have been criticized  for not representing the views and priorities of older people. We consider whether  the Rowe-Kahn SA model captures older individual's perceptions of their own health  and aging. METHODS: Using two cohorts of 886 and 483 men and women from the West of  Scotland Twenty-07 Study, aged around 57 and 76, respectively, we explored  associations between Rowe-Kahn SA dimensions (absence of disease/disability; good  physical/cognitive functioning; good interpersonal/productive social engagement) and  four aspects of self-rated health and satisfaction (current general health; health  for age; satisfaction with health; satisfaction with life). RESULTS: Respondents'  self-rated health and satisfaction was generally good but few had all six Rowe-Kahn  dimensions positive, the conventional definition of SA. All individual positive SA  dimensions were associated with better self-rated health and satisfaction. This was  consistent across age, gender, manual/nonmanual occupations, and personality. The  prevalence of good self-rated health and satisfaction increased with increasing  numbers of positive SA dimensions. IMPLICATIONS: The Rowe-Kahn model provides a  functional definition of SA.

The key research question was  whether deterioration in oral health among dentate older adults living in England  was associated with decreases in SWB, using measures of eudemonic, evaluative, and  affective dimensions of well-being. METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from  the third (2006-2007) and fifth (2010-2011) waves of respondents aged 50 and older  from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We fitted multivariable  regression models to examine the effects of changes in oral impacts on daily life  and edentulism (complete tooth loss) on SWB (quality of life, life satisfaction, and  depressive symptomatology). RESULTS: A worsening in both oral health measures was  associated with an increase in depressive symptoms even after adjusting for  time-varying confounders including declining health, activities of daily living, and  reduced social support. Becoming edentate was also associated with decreases in  quality of life and life satisfaction. DISCUSSION: A deterioration in oral health  and oral health-related quality of life increases the risk of depressive symptoms  among older adults and highlights the importance of oral health as a determinant of  subjective well-being in later life.","2018-03-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","382-386","","3","73","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26970523  PMCID: PMC5927002","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Personal Satisfaction; *Healthy Aging; Quality of Life/psychology; *Oral Health/statistics & numerical data; Activities of Daily Living/psychology; Depression/epidemiology/etiology; Mouth Diseases/complications/epidemiology; Mouth, Edentulous/complications/epidemiology/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Together, these  effects contribute to limit the onset and the progression of sarcopenia, due to the  major role played by inflammation in the pathophysiology of this disease. This  registry study evaluates the effects of Meriva® supplementation in otherwise healthy  elderly subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a registry, supplement study,  conducted in healthy subjects > 65 years with apparent loss of strength and  tiredness who freely decided to start one of the following interventions: (1)  standard management (exercise, balanced diet including proteins) (n = 33); (2)  standard management + Meriva® one tablet/day (n = 31); (3) standard management +  Meriva® one tablet/day + other supplementation (n = 22). A number of functional and  biochemical parameters were evaluated at baseline and after three months (hand grip,  weight lifting, time/distance before feeling tired after cycling, walking and  climbing stairs; general fitness, proteinuria, oxidative stress, Karnofsky scale;  left ventricular ejection fraction). RESULTS: Significant improvements in all  parameters, with respect to baseline values, were observed in the two  supplementation groups (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). On the other hand, no  improvement was observed in the standard management-only group. At three months,  inter-group comparison revealed a statistical advantage in all parameters for both  supplementation groups compared with the standard management-only group (p < 0.05  for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Our registry study shows that the addition of  Meriva® - either or not combined with other nutritional supplements - to  standardized diet and exercise plan contributes to improve strength and physical  performance in elderly subjects, potentially preventing the onset of sarcopenia.","2016","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","762-766","","4","20","","Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 26957282","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Dietary Supplements; Hand Strength/physiology; Exercise/physiology; Registries; Aging/*drug effects/physiology; Curcumin/*administration & dosage; Drug Delivery Systems/methods/*trends; Muscle Strength/*drug effects/physiology; Phospholipids/*administration & dosage; Sarcopenia/diagnosis/*prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we investigated the impact of premorbid brain  microstructural integrity, as measured by diffusion tensor imaging before surgery,  on postoperative delirium incidence and severity, as well as the relationship among  presurgical cognitive performance, diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities and  postoperative delirium. Presurgical diffusion tensor imaging scans of 136 older (≥70  years), dementia-free subjects from the prospective Successful Aging after Elective  Surgery study were analysed blind to the clinical data and delirium status. Primary  outcomes were postoperative delirium incidence and severity during the hospital  stay, as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method. We measured cognition before  surgery using general cognitive performance, a composite score based on a battery of  neuropsychological tests. We investigated the association between presurgical  diffusion tensor imaging parameters of brain microstructural integrity (i.e.  fractional anisotropy, axial, mean and radial diffusivity) with postoperative  delirium incidence and severity. Analyses were adjusted for the following potential  confounders: age, gender, vascular comorbidity status, and general cognitive  performance. Postoperative delirium occurred in 29 of 136 subjects (21%) during  hospitalization. Presurgical diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities of the  cerebellum, cingulum, corpus callosum, internal capsule, thalamus, basal forebrain,  occipital, parietal and temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, were associated  with delirium incidence and severity, after controlling for age, gender and vascular  comorbidities. After further controlling for general cognitive performance,  diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities of the cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus and  basal forebrain still remained associated with delirium incidence and severity. This  study raises the intriguing possibility that structural dysconnectivity involving  interhemispheric and fronto-thalamo-cerebellar networks, as well as microstructural  changes of structures involved in limbic and memory functions predispose to delirium  under the stress of surgery. While the diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities  observed in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and temporal lobe likely constitute the  neural substrate for the association between premorbid cognition, as measured by  general cognitive performance, and postoperative delirium, the microstructural  changes observed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus and basal forebrain seem  to constitute a separate phenomenon that predisposes to postsurgical delirium  independent of presurgical cognitive status.","2016-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:26:52","","1282-1294","","Pt 4","139","","Brain","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author (2016).

Participants were assessed using pure-tone air-conduction thresholds at octave frequencies (250; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 4,000; and 8,000 Hz). Hearing loss was grouped using 1) pure-tone averages across 4 frequencies (500 to 4000Hz) in the better ear (BE4FA) or 2) latent profile analysis (LPA) using all thresholds from both ears. Cognition was tested with the Cognitive Drug Research System, verbal fluency, and National Adult Reading Test (premorbid-IQ). Regression was used to determine the impact of HL relative to no HL on age and education-adjusted cognition, controlling for mood, sex, and premorbid-IQ.Results: According to BE4FA, 4.7% had mild (26-40 dB) HL; 0.8% had moderate (41-60 dB) HL; and 0.3% had severe (61-80 dB) HL. Based on the LPA, 20.5% had high-frequency HL; 7.8% had mid- to high-frequency HL; and 1.9% had significant HL across all frequencies. The HL group was not a predictor of cognitive performance in any domain using BE4FA and explained just 0.5% and 0.4% of variance in continuity-of-attention and speed-of-memory retrieval using LPA.

MATERIAL  AND METHODS: Leukocyte TL was measured (baseline N=2936; 6-year follow-up N=1860) in  participants (18-65 years) from the NESDA study. Baseline determinants of TL  included sociodemographics, lifestyle, chronic diseases, psychosocial stressors, and  metabolic and physiological stress markers. Multivariate linear regression models  were used to examine the associations between these determinants and (1) baseline  TL, and (2) 6-year TL change. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to  examine the predictors of telomere attrition and lengthening, as compared to stable  TL. RESULTS: Short baseline TL was associated with older age, male sex, non-European  ethnicity, cigarette smoking, recent life events, and higher triglycerides, glucose  and pre-ejection period (R(2)=11.3%). The 6-year telomere attrition was inversely  associated with baseline TL (R(2)=51.6%); also older age, long sleep, not having a  partner, high childhood trauma index, and gastrointestinal disease were associated  with 6-year TL attrition (additional R(2)=3.7%). Telomere attrition seemed to have  slightly more predictors than lengthening. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic, lifestyle,  psychosocial stress and metabolic and physiological stress factors are  cross-sectionally linked with TL. Telomere attrition over six years was strongly  associated with baseline TL, suggesting an internal homeostatic influence.  Modulation of the identified determinants may become target of future studies to  promote telomere maintenance and healthy aging.","2016-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","153-162","","","67","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, given the considerable burden  associated with living with HIV, the topic of quality-of-life (QoL) assessment has  become increasingly relevant. The aims of this study were to examine the age-related  differences in QoL and depressive symptoms of younger and middle-aged and older  adults with HIV as well as the sociodemographic, HIV-related and depressive symptoms  (cognitive-affective and somatic) associated with QoL domains. The sample consisted  of 1194 HIV-infected patients, recruited from 10 Portuguese hospitals. QoL data were  collected using the WHOQOL-HIV-Bref questionnaire. Patients also completed the Beck  Depression Inventory. Of the 1194 patients, 185 (15.5%) were over 50 years old.  Middle-aged and older patients reported significantly lower QoL in the physical,  independence and social relationships domains. Regarding the specific facets of QoL,  middle-aged and older patients reported significantly lower scores in seven of the  29 specific facets of the WHOQOL-HIV-Bref and higher scores in one facet (financial  resources). Overall, among middle-aged and older patients, higher education, being  employed, a shorter time since HIV diagnosis, use of combination anti-retroviral  therapy and fewer depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher QoL  ratings. Our findings suggest that both cognitive-affective and somatic depressive  symptoms account for significant variability in QoL scores in middle-aged and older  patients. Because an important feature of healthy ageing is maintaining QoL, these  data may provide useful information for tailoring age-appropriate and effective  interventions to improve the mental health and QoL of middle-aged and older patients  living with HIV.","2016","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:57:45","","92-98","","sup1","28 Suppl 1","","AIDS Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26881294  PMCID: PMC4828599","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Educational Status; Quality of Life; Socioeconomic Factors; Prevalence; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Confidence Intervals; Social Support; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Multiple Regression; P-Value; T-Tests; Young Adult; Portugal; Quality of Life/*psychology; Depression/*psychology; HIV Infections/*psychology; Depression; Employment; *Age Factors; Depressive symptoms; Fatigue/epidemiology; HIV; middle-aged and older adults; Portugal/epidemiology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; quality of life; Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Adolescence; Multivariate Analysis of Covariance; Data Analysis Software; Convenience Sample; Multivariate Analysis of Variance; Anti-HIV Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents -- Therapeutic Use; HIV-Positive Persons -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, prospective studies on incidence and influencing factors of cardiovascular disease and mortality are lacking.Methods: A three year follow-up study was undertaken to study the incidence and symptoms at presentation of myocardial accident, stroke and heart failure in older people with ID. Furthermore, the predictive value of cardiovascular disease risk factors on myocardial accident, stroke and heart failure and on all-cause mortality were studied. The baseline group consisted of the 1050 participants, aged 50 years and over, in the Dutch Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) study. Baseline measurements were conducted between November 2008 and July 2010. Three years after baseline, medical files of 790 participants were studied.Results: Cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure) occurred in 5.9% of the population during 3 year follow-up, and 32% of them died due to the condition. Incidence of myocardial infarction is 2.8 per 1000 personyears, for stroke 3.2 per 1000 personyears and for heart failure 12.5 per 1000 personyears. Incidence of these conditions is probably underestimated, due to atypical symptom presentation. The use of atypical antipsychotics and a history of heart failure were predictive for myocardial infarction. Heart failure was predicted by abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease and a history of heart failure. A total of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure) was predicted by abdominal obesity, a history of stroke and a history of heart failure. A low body-mass index, peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease and inflammation were predictive for 3-year all-cause mortality.Conclusion: Incidence of cardiovascular disease in older people with ID is similar to that in the general population. A pro-active assessment and treatment of the presented cardiovascular disease risk factors may reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality in older people with ID.","2016-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:12:58","","115-126","","","53-54","","Res Dev Disabil","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We here present a large twin study  investigating the trajectories of change in five systems: cardiovascular,  respiratory, skeletal, morphometric, and metabolic. Longitudinal clinical data were  collected on 3,508 female twins in the TwinsUK registry (complete pairs:740  monozygotic (MZ), 986 dizygotic (DZ), mean age at entry 48.9 ± 10.4, range 18-75  years; mean follow-up 10.2 ± 2.8 years, range 4-17.8 years). Panel data on multiple  age-related variables were used to estimate biological ages for each individual at  each time point, in linear mixed effects models. A weighted average approach was  used to combine variables within predefined body system groups. Aging trajectories  for each system in each individual were then constructed using linear modeling.  Multivariate structural equation modeling of these aging trajectories showed low  genetic effects (heritability), ranging from 2% in metabolic aging to 22% in  cardiovascular aging. However, we found a significant effect of shared environmental  factors on the variations in aging trajectories in cardiovascular (54%), skeletal  (34%), morphometric (53%), and metabolic systems (53%). The remainder was due to  environmental factors unique to each individual plus error. Multivariate Cholesky  decomposition showed that among aging trajectories for various body systems there  were significant and substantial correlations between the unique environmental  latent factors as well as shared environmental factors. However, there was no  evidence for a single common factor for aging. This study, the first of its kind in  aging, suggests that diverse organ systems share non-genetic sources of variance for  aging trajectories. Confirmatory studies are needed using population-based twin  cohorts and alternative methods of handling missing data.","2016-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:51","","27-34","","1","19","","Twin Res Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26810865","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Aging; Adolescent; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Prospective Studies; Multivariate Analysis; Funding Source; Human; aging; *Aging; Young Adult; longitudinal studies; *Health Status; Twins; *Twins, Dizygotic; *Twins, Monozygotic; multi-morbidities; multi-system changes; twin studies; Middle Age; Adolescence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: A total of  578 Greek-Cypriots aged 60-91 years were recruited from the Neurocognitive Study on  Aging. Of those, 395 healthy participants (171 males and 224 females) who met all  study criteria were retained. They completed measures of executive functioning,  working memory, receptive vocabulary and confrontational naming in addition to the  WHOQOL-BREF (brief version of the WHO QoL questionnaire). RESULTS: There were modest  but significant relationships between executive functioning, working memory,  vocabulary measures and the WHOQOL-BREF (p < 0.01). MANOVA yielded significant  gender and education effects on QoL. Sequential stepwise regression confirmed that  gender, depression scores and years of education made significant contributions to  predicting the total score on WHOQOL-BREF and accounted for 31% of the variance (R²  = 0.310). CONCLUSION: Self-reports of QoL remain stable in older adulthood.  Demographic variables such as gender and years of education affected several domains  of QoL, and, along with depression symptomatology, accounted for a significant part  of the WHOQOL-BREF variance.

OBJECTIVES: this study aimed to identify subpopulations of elderly people with  different coping profiles, describe change in participants' profiles over time and  determine the influence of coping profiles on well-being over a 5-year period.  METHODS: latent profile transition analysis (LPTA) was used in a three-wave  longitudinal data collection measuring flexibility, tenacity, depression, self-rated  health and life satisfaction among an elderly population over 65 years old. RESULTS:  three coping profiles were identified. Profile 1 was characterised by participants  with high flexibility and tenacity scores, Profile 2 with moderate flexibility and  low tenacity scores and Profile 3 with low flexibility and moderate tenacity scores.  Results indicate stability of these profiles over time, with Profile 1 being the  most adaptive in terms of ageing well. CONCLUSION: high flexibility and tenacity in  older people is a stable coping profile that is associated with successful ageing.","2016-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","287-292","","2","45","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

DESIGN AND  METHODS: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled 161,808 postmenopausal women  aged 50-79 years from 1993 to 1998. We compared successful aging indicators  collected in 2011-2012 via mailed questionnaire among 33,565 women (921 Veterans)  who reached the age of 80 years and older, according to Veteran status. A second  analysis focused on women with intact mobility at baseline who could have reached  age 80 years by December 2013. Multinominal logistic models examined Veteran status  in relation to survival to age 80 years without major disease or mobility disability  versus having prevalent or incident disease, having mobility disability, or dying  prior to age 80 years. RESULTS: Women Veterans aged 80 years and older reported  significantly lower perceived health, physical function, life satisfaction, social  support, quality of life, and purpose in life scale scores compared with  non-Veterans. The largest difference was in physical function scores (53.0 for  Veterans vs 59.5 for non-Veterans; p < .001). Women Veterans were significantly more  likely to die prior to age 80 years than non-Veteran WHI participants (multivariate  adjusted odds ratio = 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.38). In both Veteran and  non-Veteran women, healthy survival was associated with not smoking, higher physical  activity, healthy body weight, and fewer depressive symptoms. IMPLICATIONS:  Intervening upon smoking, low physical activity, obesity, and depressive symptoms  has potential to improve chances for healthy survival in older women including  Veterans.","2016-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:55","","S14-26","","Suppl 1","56 Suppl 1","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

We examined associations between long-term change of PA and arterial stiffness in the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). Methods: we assessed PA in SAPALDIA 2 (2001-03) and SAPALDIA 3 (2010-11) using a short questionnaire with a cut-off of at least 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week for sufficient activity. Arterial stiffness was measured oscillometrically by means of the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in SAPALDIA 3. We used multivariable mixed linear regression models adjusted for several potential confounders in 2,605 persons aged 50-81. Results: adjusted means of baPWV were significantly lower in persons with sufficient moderate-to-vigorous PA (i) in SAPALDIA 2 but not in SAPALDIA 3 (P = 0.048) and (ii) in both surveys (P = 0.001) compared with persons with insufficient activity in both surveys. There was a significant interaction between sex and the level of change in PA concerning baPWV (P = 0.03). The triples of parameter estimates describing the association between level of PA change and baPWV were not significantly different between the two sex-specific models (P = 0.07). Conclusions: keeping up or adopting a physically active lifestyle was associated with lower arterial stiffness in older adults after a follow-up of almost a decade. Increasing the proportion of older adults adhering to PA recommendations incorporating also vigorous PA may have a considerable impact on vascular health at older age and may contribute to healthy ageing in general.","2016-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:40:10","","110-115","","1","45","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2016.

In healthy aging, however, the temporal relationship between  change in brain iron content and age-related volume loss is unclear. Here, we  present the first long-term longitudinal multi-occasion investigation of changes in  iron content and volume in the neostriatum in a sample of healthy middle-aged and  older adults (N=32; ages 49-83years at baseline). Iron content, estimated via R2*  relaxometry, increased in the putamen, but not the caudate nucleus. In the former,  the rate of accumulation was coupled with change in volume. Moreover, greater  baseline iron content predicted faster shrinkage and smaller volumes seven years  later. Older age partially accounted for individual differences in neostriatal iron  content and volume, but vascular risk did not. Thus, brain iron content may be a  promising biomarker of impending decline in normal aging.","2016-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","11-20","","","128","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, all patients completed  a mini-mental state examination test, geriatric depression scale, and activities of  daily living scale. RESULTS: Complex attention tests and long-term memory tests were  more impaired in MCI patients when compared with ARCD. However, there were no  significant differences between the MCI and ARCD cases in activities of daily  living. Memory and executive functions were more deteriorated in patients with AD in  comparison to MCI.

However, little attention has been given to  the strength of these effects across specific age intervals from birth to old age.  In this paper, we study the effect of the family's socioeconomic position and  mother's marital status at birth on all-cause mortality at different age intervals  in a Swedish cohort of 11 868 individuals followed across their lifespan. METHODS:  Using the Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study, we fitted Cox regression  models to estimate age-varying HRs of all-cause mortality according to mother's  marital status and family's socioeconomic position. RESULTS: Mother's marital status  and family's socioeconomic position at birth were associated with higher mortality  rates throughout life (HR 1.18 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.26) for unmarried mothers; 1.19  (95% CI 1.12 to 1.25) for low socioeconomic position). While the effect of family's  socioeconomic position showed little variation across different age groups, the  effect of marital status was stronger for infant mortality (HR 1.47 (95% CI 1.23 to  1.76); p=0.04 for heterogeneity). The results remained robust when early life and  adult mediator variables were included. CONCLUSIONS: Family's socioeconomic position  and mother's marital status involve different dimensions of social stratification  with independent effects on mortality throughout life. Our findings support the  importance of improving early-life conditions in order to enhance healthy ageing.","2016-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:59:15","","569-575","","6","70","","J Epidemiol Community Health","","","","","","","","eng","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Whether further gains in life expectancy will be paired by improvements in health is uncertain. We therefore analyze the effect of population ageing on health services use under different health scenarios. We focus on the possibly diverging trends between different dimensions of health and their effect on health services use.Methods: Using longitudinal data on health and health services use, a latent Markov model has been estimated that includes different dimensions of health. We use this model to perform a simulation study and analyze the health dynamics that drive the effect of population aging. We simulate three health scenarios on the relationship between longevity and health (expansion of morbidity, compression of morbidity, and the dynamic equilibrium scenario). We use the scenarios to predict costs of health services use in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2050.Results: Hospital use is predicted to decline after 2040, whereas long-term care will continue to rise up to 2050. Considerable differences in expenditure growth rates between scenarios with the same life expectancy but different trends in health are found. Compression of morbidity generally leads to the lowest growth. The effect of additional life expectancy gains within the same health scenario is relatively small for hospital care, but considerable for long-term care.Conclusions: By comparing different health scenarios resulting in the same life expectancy, we show that health improvements do contain costs when they decrease morbidity but not mortality. This suggests that investing in healthy aging can contribute to containing health expenditure growth.","2015-12-24","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:39:32","","574","","","15","","BMC Health Serv Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26704342  PMCID: PMC4690430","","","","Aged; Humans; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Forecasting; Longitudinal Studies; Population Dynamics; Demography; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Life Expectancy; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Netherlands; *Longevity; *Health Status; *Life Expectancy; Morbidity/trends; Costs and Cost Analysis; Health Expenditures/trends; Health Services for the Aged/economics/*statistics & numerical data/trends; Investments; Long-Term Care/economics/statistics & numerical data; Morbidity -- Trends; Health Care Costs -- Trends; Health Services for the Aged -- Economics; Health Services for the Aged -- Trends; Health Services for the Aged -- Utilization; Long Term Care -- Economics; Long Term Care -- Utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aims to determine whether falling into multidimensional poverty lowers self-efficacy. Methods Longitudinal analysis of waves 7-11 (2007-2011) of the nationally representative Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey using linear regression models. The analysis focused on the Australian population aged 65 years and older. The Freedom Poverty Measure was used to identify those in multidimensional poverty. Results Those who fell into multidimensional poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 had their self-efficacy scores decline by an average of 27 points ( SD 21.2). Those who fell into poverty had significantly lower self-efficacy scores in 2011 - up to 57% lower (−66.6%, −45.7% P < 0.0001) after being in multidimensional poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 than those who were never in poverty. Conclusions Falling into multidimensional poverty lowers the self-efficacy scores of older people.

Successfully managing increased pain requires the ability to switch attention away from the pain and towards adaptive health cognitions and behaviours. However, no study to date has tested how pain interacts with task-switching ability to predict future health in older adults. Additionally, no study has tested whether objective (i.e., task-switching performance) or subjective measures of cognitive ability have a stronger impact on future health.Design/methods: The current study tested these interactions in community-dwelling older adults. Participants included 150 older adults who provided pain, task-switching ability, subjective cognitive functioning, and health data every 6 months for up to 5 years.Results: Multilevel modelling was used to analyse the data, yielding gammas (γ) analogous to unstandardized beta weights in regression. A significant interaction between task-switching and pain indicated that when task-switching ability was lower than usual, higher-than-usual pain predicted poorer health at the following wave (γ = 0.30, SE = 0.12, t(663) = 2.45, p = .009; 95% CI: 0.07-0.65). When task-switching ability was higher than usual, there was no effect of pain on health (γ = -0.13, t(663) = -0.85, p = .39; 95% CI: -0.44-0.17). No significant interaction was found for subjective cognitive functioning.Conclusions: Objective task-switching ability, but not subjective cognitive functioning, may have health-protective effects when older adults experience increases in pain.Statement Of Contribution: What is already known on the subject? As people age, they are more likely to experience pain. Increases in pain threaten health. Older adults are at particular risk for both increased pain and poor health. What does this study add? When pain levels are higher than usual, task-switching ability protects older adults from future declines in health. Within people, task-switching ability interacts with pain to promote healthy ageing.","2016-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:46:26","","434-450","","2","21","","Br J Health Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 The British Psychological Society.","","","","","","PMID: 26688002  PMCID: PMC4826858","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Funding Source; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; older adults; *Geriatric Assessment; Cognition/*physiology; Attention; *Health Status; Aging/psychology; Health Behavior/*physiology; Attention/*physiology; beta-2 microglobulin; executive functioning; interleukin-6; pain; Pain/*psychology; Pain -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the longitudinal study on  neuroprotective model for healthy longevity (LRGS TUA) has been designed to  prospectively investigate the magnitude of cognitive decline and its risk factors  through a comprehensive multidimensional assessment comprising of biophysical  health, auditory and visual function, nutrition and dietary pattern and psychosocial  aspects. At baseline, subjects were interviewed for their status on  sociodemographic, health, neuropsychological test, psychosocial and dietary intake.  Subjects were also measured for anthropometric and physical function and fitness.  Biospecimens including blood, buccal swap, hair and toenail were collected,  processed and stored. A subsample was assessed for sensory function, i.e., vision  and auditory. During follow-up, at 18 and 36 months, most of the measurements, along  with morbidity and mortality outcomes will be collected. The description of mild  cognitive impairment, successful aging and usual aging process is presented here. A  total 2322 respondents were recruited in the data analysis at baseline. Most of the  respondents were categorized as experiencing usual aging (73 %), followed by  successful aging (11 %) and mild cognitive impairment (16 %).

We combined z scores from multiple  biomarkers to describe haematopoiesis, inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism,  liver function, renal function, and cellular senescence domains. In Cox proportional  hazard models, inflammation predicted all-cause mortality with hazard ratios (95%  CI) 1.89 (1.21 to 2.95) and 1.36 (1.05 to 1.78) in the very old and  (semi-)supercentenarians, respectively. In linear forward stepwise models,  inflammation predicted capability (10.8% variance explained) and cognition (8(.)6%  variance explained) in (semi-)supercentenarians better than chronologic age or  gender. The inflammation score was also lower in centenarian offspring compared to  age-matched controls with Δ (95% CI) = - 0.795 (- 1.436 to - 0.154). Centenarians  and their offspring were able to maintain long telomeres, but telomere length was  not a predictor of successful ageing in centenarians and semi-supercentenarians.

Education may influence healthy aging through improved employment opportunities that enhance feelings of personal control and reduce hazardous exposures, or through higher incomes that enable individuals to access better health care or to reside in better neighbourhoods. Income and occupation have not been explored extensively as potential mediators of the effect of education on healthy aging. This study investigates the role of income and occupation in the association between education and healthy aging including potential effect modification by gender.Methods: Logistic regression was used to explore the association of education, income (perceived income adequacy, life satisfaction with finances) and occupation (occupational prestige) with healthy aging five years later in 946 community-dwelling adults 65+ years from a population-based, prospective cohort study in Manitoba, Canada.Results: Higher levels of education generally increased the likelihood of healthy aging. After adjusting for education, both income measures, but not occupation, predicted healthy aging among men; furthermore, the association between education and healthy aging was no longer significant. Income and occupation did not explain the significant association between education and healthy aging among women.Conclusions: Perceived income adequacy and life satisfaction with finances explained the beneficial effects of higher education on healthy aging among men, but not women. Identifying predictors of healthy aging and the mechanisms through which these factors exert their effects can inform strategies to maximize the likelihood of healthy aging.","2015-11-25","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:29:07","","1181","","","15","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26607694  PMCID: PMC4660771","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Personal Satisfaction; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Canada; Aging/*psychology; Income/*statistics & numerical data; Income; Employment; Manitoba; Occupations/*statistics & numerical data; Logistic Regression; Occupations and Professions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and  its sulphated form DHEA(S) have been associated with mood and healthy aging.  Associations with mental illness over the middle to late years of life have not yet  been extensively investigated in large, western community-dwelling samples. The aim  of this study was to investigate whether low DHEA(S) levels are associated with the  development of depressive symptoms in a large longitudinal cohort study of older men  and women. We assessed data from English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) to  evaluate the association of DHEA(S) levels and depressive symptoms measured by  Center for Epidemiologic Studies Scale (CES-D) at baseline (n=3083) and at 4-year  follow-up (n=3009). At baseline, there was an inverse association between DHEA(S)  and depressive symptoms (B=-0.252, p=0.014). Adjustments for physical illnesses,  impairments in cognitive function and health behaviors abolished this association  (p=0.109) at baseline. Decreased DHEA(S) levels at baseline also predicted incident  depression at 4-year follow-up (B=-0.332, p<0.001).

This article explores the concept of resilience in the context of  vision impairment using two linked sets of narrative interview data from 2007 to  2010. Three case studies were analysed in detail using a framework approach based  upon a social-ecological model of resilience and vision impairment. Within the model  a range of assets and resources are identified which influence an individual's  capacity for resilience. A set of criteria were used to establish the extent to  which each individual appeared to be resilient at each point in time. Analysis  revealed that it is not merely the presence or absence of individual, social, and  community resources - but how these resources interact with each other - that  influences resilience and can create a risk to wellbeing. To possess only some of  these resources is not sufficient; there is a co-dependency between these resources  which requires the presence of other resources for resilience to be achieved.  Resilience is not a fixed state; individuals can become more or less resilient as  their circumstances and resources change over time. We suggest that the concept of  resilience has much to offer the field of vision impairment as it allows the  identification of enablers as well as areas of barriers to improving people's health  and wellbeing and suggests further opportunities for service providers to engage  with clients, even those who appear to be supported, as people's social, economic  and emotional landscapes continue to change over time, rather than identifying  deficit.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","37-48","","","35","","J Aging Stud","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Markedly, there have been only few quantitative MRI works on the ERC geometric measurements in pediatric and adult healthy subjects across the lifespan. Here, we sought to fill this gap in knowledge by quantifying the ERC thickness in a very large cohort of subjects spanning 9 decades of life.Methods: Using magnetic resonance imaging data from multiple centers (IXI, MMRR, NKI, OASIS combined with the NIH-Child Dev database and locally recruited healthy subjects), we analyzed the lifespan trajectory of ERC thickness in 1,660 healthy controls ranging from 2 to 94 years of age.Results: The ERC thickness increased with age, reached a peak at about 44 years, and then decreased with age. ERC thickness is hemispherically rightward-asymmetric with no gender differences. Mean ERC thickness was found to vary between 2.943 ± .438 mm and 3.525 ± .355 mm across different age populations. Also, more pronounced loss of the ERC thickness in healthy aging men was noticeable.Discussion: Our report with high spatial resolution brain MRI data from 1,660 healthy controls provided important clues about ERC thickness across lifespan.

He theorized that the consequences of not meeting developmental  challenges included stagnation and emotional despair. Drawing on this model, the  present study uses prospective longitudinal data to examine how the quality of  assessed Eriksonian psychosocial development in midlife relates to late-life  cognitive and emotional functioning. In particular we were interested to see whether  late-life depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian development and  specific domains of cognitive functioning (i.e., executive functioning and memory).  Participants were 159 men from the over-75 year longitudinal Study of Adult  Development. The sample was comprised of men from both higher and lower  socioeconomic strata. Eriksonian psychosocial development was coded from men's  narrative responses to interviews between the ages of 30-47 (Vaillant & Milofsky,  1980). In late life (ages 75-85) men completed a performance-based  neuropsychological assessment measuring global cognitive status, executive  functioning, and memory. In addition depressive symptomatology was assessed using  the Geriatric Depression Scale. Our results indicated that higher midlife Eriksonian  psychosocial development was associated with stronger global cognitive functioning  and executive functioning, and lower levels of depression 3 to 4 decades later.  There was no significant association between Eriksonian development and late-life  memory. Late-life depression mediated the relationship between Eriksonian  development and both global cognition and executive functioning. All of these  results controlled for highest level of education and adolescent intelligence.  Findings have important implications for understanding the lasting benefits of  psychosocial engagement in mid-adulthood for late-life cognitive and emotional  health. In addition, it may be that less successful psychosocial development  increases levels of depression making individuals more vulnerable to specific areas  of cognitive decline.","2016-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:34:10","","496-508","","3","52","","Dev Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).","","","","","","PMID: 26551530  PMCID: PMC5398200","","","","Aged; Humans; Male; Aging; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Neuropsychological Tests; Models, Psychological; Prospective Studies; Human Development; Human; Scales; *Cognition; Executive Function; Aging/*psychology; *Mental Health; Neuropsychology; *Emotions; *Human Development; Depression/epidemiology/psychology; Middle Age; Interviews; Geriatric Depression Scale; Depression -- Risk Factors; Functional Assessment Inventory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has led to a need for an in-depth understanding of factors associated with healthy aging in people with long-term SCI.Objective: To present the methodology and initial results of the Swedish Aging with Spinal Cord Injury Study, a longitudinal cohort survey targeting older adults with long-term SCI.Design: Cross-sectional cohort study.Setting: Home and community settings.Participants: People aged 50 years or older with SCI for at least 10 years.Methods: Data were collected through interviews and assessments during home visits and from the participants' medical records.Main Outcome Measurements: Study-specific protocol with custom-designed questions, and validated generic and SCI-specific assessment tools focusing on functioning, disability, health, well-being, lifestyle, and personal and environmental factors.Results: Of 795 potential participants, 184 matched the inclusion criteria and the final sample comprised 123 participants (67% response rate; 36 women and 87 men, mean age 63 ± 9 years, mean time since injury 24 ± 12 years). Traumatic SCI accounted for 62%, and 31% had sustained a complete SCI. A majority was married or had a partner, and used some form of assistance and/or mobility device. Thirty-five percent were working full-time or part-time. Based on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), 3 groups of SCI severity were formed. There were no significant differences in chronological age, marital status, or vocational situation between the tetraplegia AIS A-C group (n = 22), the paraplegia AIS A-C group (n = 41), and the all AIS D group (n = 60). Participants in the all AIS D group were significantly older at injury, had a shorter time since injury, and were less likely to use mobility devices compared with the other 2 groups.Conclusion: These baseline data of the Swedish Aging with Spinal Cord Injury Study provide a description of older adults with long-term SCI.

Dietary data were collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Total diet scores (TDS) were allocated for intake of selected food groups and nutrients for each participant as described in the national dietary guidelines. Higher scores indicated closer adherence to dietary guidelines. Successful aging was defined as the absence of disability, depressive symptoms, cognitive impairment, respiratory symptoms, and chronic diseases (cancer, coronary artery disease, and stroke).Results: At 10-year follow-up, 610 (37.9%) participants had died and 249 (15.5%) participants aged successfully.

METHOD:  Multilevel logistic regression models and four waves of panel data from a large  nationally representative survey of older adults in China were employed. RESULTS:  Those who had a tourism experience tended to be younger, men, urban residents, have  a higher socioeconomic status (SES), and frequently participate in leisure  activities and exercise. However, controlling for SES, women were more likely than  men to have a tourism experience. Notably, tourism was negatively associated with  poor self-rated health and the association was robust to adjustments for a wide  range of confounders. DISCUSSION: The net beneficial impact of tourism on self-rated  health may operate through several mechanisms such as improvements in tourists'  cognitive functioning, healthy lifestyles, self-esteen, family and social relations,  and psychological and spirtual well-being.

According to the ""last-in-first-out""  hypothesis of brain aging late-developing WM tracts may be particularly vulnerable  to advanced age. To test this hypothesis we compared age-related changes in  association, commissural and projection WM fiber regions using a skeletonized,  region of interest DTI approach. Using linear mixed effect models, we evaluated the  influences of age and vascular risk at baseline on seven-year changes in three  indices of WM integrity and organization (axial diffusivity, AD, radial diffusivity,  RD, and fractional anisotropy, FA) in healthy middle-aged and older adults (mean  age=65.4, SD=9.0years). Association fibers showed the most pronounced declines over  time. Advanced age was associated with greater longitudinal changes in RD and FA,  independent of fiber type. Furthermore, older age was associated with longitudinal  RD increases in late-developing, but not early-developing projection fibers. These  findings demonstrate the increased vulnerability of later developing WM regions and  support the ""last-in-first-out"" hypothesis of brain aging.","2016-01-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","74-83","","","125","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The group living with sensors (n =  52) had an average LOS of 1,557 days (4.3 years); the comparison group without  sensors (n = 81) was 936 days (2.6 years); p = .0006. Groups were comparable based  on admission age, gender, number of chronic illnesses, SF12 physical health, SF12  mental health, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), activities of daily living,  independent activities of daily living, and mini-mental status examination scores.  Both groups, all residents living at TigerPlace since the implementation of health  alerts, receive registered nurse (RN) care coordination as the standard of care.  DISCUSSION: Results indicate that residents living with sensors were able to reside  at TigerPlace 1.7 years longer than residents living without sensors, suggesting  that proactive use of health alerts facilitates successful aging in place. Health  alerts, generated by automated algorithms interpreting environmentally embedded  sensor data, may enable care coordinators to assess and intervene on health status  changes earlier than is possible in the absence of sensor-generated alerts.  Comparison of LOS without sensors TigerPlace (2.6 years) with the national median in  residential senior housing (1.8 years) may be attributable to the RN care  coordination model at TigerPlace. Cost estimates comparing cost of living at  TigerPlace with the sensor technology vs. nursing home reveal potential saving of  about $30,000 per person. Potential cost savings to Medicaid funded nursing home  (assuming the technology and care coordination were reimbursed) are estimated to be  about $87,000 per person. CONCLUSIONS: Early alerts for potential health problems  appear to enhance the current RN care coordination care delivery model at  TigerPlace, increasing LOS for those living with sensors to nearly twice that of  those who did not. Sensor technology with care coordination has cost saving  potential for consumers and Medicaid.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","650-655","","6","63","","Nurs Outlook","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Self-control of emotional reward cues is an  important behavioral factor for regulation of weight gain through voluntary diet  control and physical activity. METHODS: We tested the associations between  teacher-rated self-control at ages 13 and 15 years, and measured body mass index  (BMI) between ages 15 and 60-64 years, controlling for confounding factors such as  affective symptoms and cognition, using 3873 study members in the Medical Research  Council National Survey of Health and Development, also known as the British 1946  birth cohort. RESULTS: Multivariable regression analysis after adjustment for all  covariates showed that lower self-control was associated with higher BMI in all  measure points (P<0.05). Multilevel modeling using a cubic model showed that there  was an association between self-control and BMI at 15 years in females (male:  BMI=-0.00 kg m(-2) per 1 s.d. on the self-control score (95% confidence interval  (CI): -0.12 to 0.11), P =0.94; female: BMI=-0.27 (-0.42 to -0.11), P<0.001). The  association became stronger with age in both sexes (BMI=-0.065 (-0.082 to -0.048),  P<0.001; BMI=-0.036 (-0.057 to -0.015), P<0.001). By age 60-64 years, the  association between self-control and BMI in men had increased to -0.70 (-0.96 to  -0.44) and -0.67 (-1.04 to -0.30) in women. CONCLUSIONS: Lower adolescent  self-control was associated with higher BMI through the life course, and this  becomes stronger with age. Investigations to test whether intervention to  self-control improves obesity are recommended.","2016-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","71-76","","1","40","","Int J Obes (Lond)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26449420  PMCID: PMC4704138","","","","Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Adolescent; Adult; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Body Weight; Age Factors; Self-Control/*psychology; United Kingdom/epidemiology; *Weight Gain; Obesity/epidemiology/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined: (a) profiles of early experiences  across multiple domains, (b) the relations of these profiles to hedonic and  eudaimonic well-being in later life, and (c) whether midlife social support mediated  these relations. We first conducted latent class analysis of early experiences using  data from 1,076 men in the VA Normative Aging Study who completed the Childhood  Experiences Scale (age: M = 69, SD = 7). Analyses yielded 3 profiles of early  experiences, labeled as cherished (strong support and some losses), harshly  disciplined (harsh parental discipline, low positive reinforcement, and nonnormative  stressors), and ordinary (few stressors and low parental attention). Next, we  applied structural equation modeling to data on a subset of this sample assessed 7  years later on hedonic and eudaimonic well-being (n = 496; age: M = 76, SD = 7). In  general, the cherished group reported stronger qualitative social support in midlife  than the harshly disciplined and ordinary groups, which in turn was related to  greater hedonic (life satisfaction, positive affect) and eudaimonic (competence,  positive relations with others) well-being in later life. The cherished group also  reported higher autonomy than the ordinary group, but this association was  independent of midlife social support. Our findings suggest that experiencing  adversity in the context of a nurturing early environment can promote successful  aging through the maintenance of supportive relationships in midlife.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:46:55","","894-910","","4","30","","Psychol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).","","","","","","PMID: 26436456  PMCID: PMC4679661","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Longitudinal Studies; United States; Prospective Studies; Social Support; Child; Personal Satisfaction; Funding Source; Human; Scales; *Aging; Achievement; *Veterans; *Achievement; Parenting/*psychology; Parents/*psychology; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans; Questionnaires; Support, Psychosocial; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; Parenting; Parents -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The best-known and most severe  historical cases of famine include the Dutch 'Hunger Winter,' the Finnish famine,  the Chinese Great famine, and the siege of Leningrad. The siege of Leningrad (now  Saint Petersburg) was one of the longest in history, lasting 872 days, from  September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944. There were 670,000 registered deaths of the  civil population, in which 97% died due to starvation. The aim of the present study  is to create a collection of biospecimens from extensively phenotyped siege of  Leningrad survivors, who underwent starvation during the early periods of their  lives, and from a matched control group. METHODS: A total 305 siege survivors and 51  age- and sex- matched control subjects were investigated in of an observational  retroprospective cohort study in 2009-2011 at a baseline visit. After 3 years of  follow-up, 252 siege survivors (182 females and 70 males; mean age 74.7 ± 2.6 years)  and 45 controls (32 females and 13 males; mean age 75.5 ± 2.8 years) were examined.  All siege survivors were exposed to the extreme dietary restriction and stress  associated with the siege in their early childhood. All participants signed informed  consent and were subject to questionnaires and physical examination, as well as  various laboratory and instrumental tests. Anthropometry, blood measurement,  cognitive and physiological testing, and vascular damage assessment were performed.  RESULTS: Blood specimens of the extensively phenotyped siege survivors were  collected and processed (blood plasma, blood serum, and flash-frozen PBMC); serum  and urine were used for laboratory tests. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that data obtained  from this unique collection of biospecimens can elucidate the mechanisms of healthy  aging and emphasize the importance of reproductive health, counseling, and  monitoring among people with eating disorders.","2015-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","371-375","","5","13","","Biopreserv Biobank","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26417917","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Retrospective Studies; *Biological Specimen Banks; Phenotype; *Starvation; Russia; Survivors/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At a single dementia clinic, we evaluated the ability of a linear support vector machine trained with completely unrelated data to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia, and healthy aging based on 3D-T1 weighted MRI data sets. Furthermore, we predicted progression to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline and automatically quantified white matter hyperintensities from FLAIR-images. Separating additionally recruited healthy elderly from those with dementia was accurate with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (according to Fig. 4). Multi-class separation of patients with either AD or FTD from other included groups was good on the training set (AUC >  0.9) but substantially less accurate (AUC = 0.76 for AD, AUC = 0.78 for FTD) on 134 cases from the local clinic. Longitudinal data from 28 cases with MCI at baseline and appropriate follow-up data were available. The computer tool discriminated progressive from stable MCI with AUC = 0.73, compared to AUC = 0.80 for the training set. A relatively low accuracy by clinicians (AUC = 0.81) illustrates the difficulties of predicting conversion in this heterogeneous cohort. This first application of a MRI-based pattern recognition method to a routine sample demonstrates feasibility, but also illustrates that automated multi-class differential diagnoses have to be the focus of future methodological developments and application studies.","2015","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:36:31","","939-954","","4","47","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26401773  PMCID: PMC4923764","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Funding Source; Human; Brain -- Pathology; Linear Models; Brain/*pathology; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; machine learning; White Matter/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Aging/pathology; *Support Vector Machine; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/pathology; Dementia diagnostics; Frontotemporal Dementia/*diagnosis/pathology; Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods; Lewy Body Disease/*diagnosis/pathology; magnetic resonance imaging; prognosis; support vector machine; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease -- Diagnosis; Linear Regression; Alzheimer's Disease -- Pathology; Frontotemporal Dementia -- Diagnosis; Frontotemporal Dementia -- Pathology; Imaging, Three-Dimensional -- Methods; Lewy Body Disease -- Diagnosis; Lewy Body Disease -- Pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the  popularity of the MoCA, there has been little research into how performance on the  MoCA changes over time in healthy older adults. METHODS: The present study examined  a sample of older adults (n = 53) recruited for a longitudinal study of healthy  aging. Change in total MoCA score at three time points (baseline, 12 months, and  48 months) and scores from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of  Neuropsychological Status at five time points (RBANS; baseline 12 months, 24 months,  36 months, and 48 months) were assessed using repeated measures analyses. RESULTS:  Total MoCA score significantly increased across time, particularly between the first  and second administrations. Scores did not significantly differ between the second  (12 month) and third (48 month) administrations. When grouped by baseline  performance, individuals who scored low at baseline significantly improved  performance at 12-month testing, but had little change between 12- and 48-month  testing. Conversely, individuals who scored high at baseline did not significantly  change between baseline and 12-month testing, but improved between 12- and 48-month  testing. RBANS scores did not significantly change over time. CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that the MoCA may be susceptible to practice effects, particularly  between the first and second administrations. These practice effects should be taken  into consideration when repeatedly employing the MoCA to screen for cognitive status  in healthy older adults.","2015","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","824-835","","6","29","","Clin Neuropsychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26373627  PMCID: PMC4644436","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Cognition/*physiology; Research Design; MoCA.; Neuropsychological assessment; Neuropsychological Tests/*standards; Practice effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These suggestions include defining and measuring SA as a developmental process, including subjective indicators alongside more objective ones, and expressing SA on a continuum. Design and Methods: Data were used from 2,241 respondents in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a multidisciplinary study in a nationally representative sample of older adults in the Netherlands. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify successful 16-year trajectories within nine indicators of physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning. SA was quantified as the number of indicators in which individual respondents showed successful trajectories (range 0-9). Results: Successful trajectories were characterized by stability, limited decline, or even improvement of functioning over time. Of the respondents, 39.6% of men and 29.3% of women were successful in at least seven indicators; 7% of men and 11% of women were successful in less than three indicators. Proportions of successful respondents were largest in life satisfaction (>85%) and smallest in social activity (<25%). Correlations of success between separate indicators were low to moderate (range r = .02-.37). Implications: Many older adults age relatively successfully, but the character of successful functioning over time varies between indicators, and the combinations of successful indicators vary between individuals.","2017-04-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:58:04","","240-251","","2","57","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2015.

This study investigated the longitudinal association  between social participation and two domains of cognitive functioning, memory and  executive function. A primary goal of our analyses was to determine whether social  participation predicted cognitive functioning over-and-above physical health,  depression, and physical activity in a sample with adequate power to detect unique  effects. METHOD: The sample included aging adults (N = 19,832) who participated in a  large, multi-national study and provided data across six years; split into two  random subsamples. Unique associations between the predictors of interest and  cognitive functioning over time and within occasion were assessed in a latent curve  growth model. RESULTS: Social participation predicted both domains of cognitive  functioning at each occasion, and the relative magnitude of this effect was  comparable to physical health, depression, and physical activity level. In addition,  social participation at the first time point predicted change in cognitive  functioning over time. The substantive results in the initial sample were replicated  in the second independent subsample. CONCLUSION: Overall, the magnitude of the  association of social participation is comparable to other well-established  predictors of cognitive functioning, providing evidence that social participation  plays an important role in cognitive functioning and successful aging.","2017-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:56:34","","133-146","","2","21","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 26327492","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Aging; Europe; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Memory; Prospective Studies; Health Surveys; Confidence Intervals; Psychological Tests; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Human; P-Value; Scales; Comparative Studies; Self Report; *Exercise; Cognition/physiology; *social participation; *Social Participation; *cognition; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; *physical health; Social Participation; Executive Function/*physiology; Memory/physiology; *physical activity; *depression; Depression; Depression/*physiopathology; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Summated Rating Scaling; Random Sample; Physical Activity; Data Analysis Software; Effect Size; Data Analysis, Statistical; Variable; Coding; Executive Function -- Evaluation; Translations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results indicated possible bidirectional coupling between Fine Motor and Speed.Conclusions: Combined with other dual change score model analyses of cognition and physical function, a picture is beginning to emerge of the cascade of events that may lead to cognitive aging.","2016-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:44:39","","109-116","","1","71","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2015.

This exploratory study used a retrospective  cross-sectional design to determine the construct validity of a subset of 3 items  (weight loss, appetite, and swallowing difficulty) currently on the SCREEN-II and  SCREEN-II-AB tools. Secondary data on community-dwelling senior males (n = 522, mean  ± SD age = 86.7 ± 3.0 years) in the Manitoba Follow-up Study (MFUS) study were  available for analysis. Participants completed the mailed MFUS Nutrition Survey that  included SCREEN-II items and questions pertaining to self-rated health, diet  healthiness, and rating of the importance of nutrition towards successful aging as  the constructs for comparison. Self-perceived health status (F = 14.7, P < 0.001),  diet healthiness (ρ = 0.17, P = 0.002) and the rating of nutrition's importance to  aging (ρ = 0.10, P = 0.03) were correlated with the 3-item score. Inferences were  consistent with associations between these construct variables and the full  SCREEN-II. Three items from SCREEN-II and SCREEN-II-AB demonstrate initial construct  validity with self-perceived health status and diet healthiness ratings by older  males; further exploration for criterion and predictive validity in more diverse  samples is needed.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:13:05","","194-199","","4","76","","Can J Diet Pract Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 26280678","","","","Aged; Humans; Male; Aging; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Nutritional Status; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Reproducibility of Results; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; P-Value; Scales; Validation Studies; Retrospective Studies; Fruit; Vegetables; Canada; *Health Behavior; *Surveys and Questionnaires; *Feeding Behavior; Manitoba; *Nutrition Assessment; Weight Loss; Questionnaires; Secondary Analysis; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Data Analysis Software; Post Hoc Analysis; Instrument Validation; Retrospective Design; Men's Health; Appetite -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Community Living -- In Old Age; Construct Validity; Deglutition -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Diet -- In Old Age; Exploratory Research; Geriatric Nutrition; Health Beliefs -- In Old Age; Nutritional Assessment -- In Old Age; Self Report -- In Old Age; Weight Loss -- Evaluation -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: Our study's objective was to investigate the association between  empirically derived DPs in midlife and HA after 13 y of follow-up. METHODS: Baseline  dietary data from repeated 24-h dietary records (on average, 10 records per  participant) of a subsample of the SU.VI.MAX (SUpplémentation en Vitamines et  Minéraux AntioXydants) study allowed extraction of 2 DPs with the use of principal  components analysis on 37 food groups. HA was assessed in 2007-2009 among 2796  participants of the SU.VI.MAX study aged 45-60 y at baseline (1994-1995), who were  initially free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. HA was defined as  not developing any major chronic disease, good physical and cognitive functioning,  no limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no depressive symptoms,  no health-related limitations in social life, good overall self-perceived health,  and no function-limiting pain. The association between DPs (in tertiles) and HA was  evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression, and a potential interaction  with energy intake was investigated. RESULTS: A ""Western"" and a ""healthy"" DP were  identified. After adjustment for a large number of potential confounders, there was  no significant association between the Western DP and HA. Moreover, the healthy  pattern was not associated with HA among subjects with high (i.e., greater than or  equal to the median) energy intake. Among subjects with low (i.e., less than the  median) energy intake, on the other hand, higher scores on the healthy DP were  related to higher odds of HA (OR for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.11,  2.00; P-trend = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Adherence to a healthy diet in midlife that  provides micronutrients, fiber, and antioxidants while regulating energy intake may  help to promote HA.","2015-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2139-2145","","9","145","","J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26246320","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Diet Records; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; *Aging; healthy aging; *Energy Intake; Diet, Western; *Health Promotion; *Feeding Behavior; nutrition; dietary patterns; *Appetite Regulation; Antioxidants/administration & dosage; Dietary Fiber/administration & dosage; energy intake; Micronutrients/administration & dosage; midlife exposure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study  investigated whether it is possible to boost positive affect and associated positive  biases in this age group using cognitive training. The effect of computerised  imagery-based cognitive bias modification on positive affect, vividness of positive  prospective imagery and interpretation biases in older adults was measured. 77 older  adults received 4 weeks (12 sessions) of imagery cognitive bias modification or a  control condition. They were assessed at baseline, post-training and at a one-month  follow-up. Both groups reported decreased negative affect and trait anxiety, and  increased optimism across the three assessments. Imagery cognitive bias modification  significantly increased the vividness of positive prospective imagery post-training,  compared with the control training. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no  difference between the training groups in negative interpretation bias. This is a  useful demonstration that it is possible to successfully engage older adults in  computer-based cognitive training and to enhance the vividness of positive imagery  about the future in this group. Future studies are needed to assess the longer-term  consequences of such training and the impact on affect and wellbeing in more  vulnerable groups.","2015-11-30","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","36-43","","1","230","","Psychiatry Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

By adapting the transitivity paradigm (Bunsey and  Eichenbaum (1996) Nature 379:255-257), which traditionally has been used in nonhuman  animal research, this work examined the extent to which aging is accompanied by  deficits in relational learning and flexible expression of relational information.  Older adults' performance was additionally contrasted with that of amnesic case DA  to understand the critical contributions of the medial temporal lobe, and  specifically, the hippocampus, which endures structural and functional changes in  healthy aging. Participants were required to select the correct choice item (B  versus Y) based on the presented sample item (e.g., A). Pairwise relations must be  learned (A->B, B->C, C->D) so that ultimately, the correct relations can be inferred  when presented with a novel probe item (A->C?Z?). Participants completed four  conditions of transitivity that varied in terms of the degree to which the stimuli  and the relations among them were known pre-experimentally. Younger adults, older  adults, and DA performed similarly when the condition employed all  pre-experimentally known, semantic, relations. Older adults and DA were less  accurate than younger adults when all to-be-learned relations were arbitrary.  However, accuracy improved for older adults when they could use pre-experimentally  known pairwise relations to express understanding of arbitrary relations as indexed  through inference judgments. DA could not learn arbitrary relations nor use existing  knowledge to support novel inferences. These results suggest that while aging has  often been associated with an emerging decline in hippocampal function, prior  knowledge can be used to support novel inferences. However, in case DA, significant  damage to the hippocampus likely impaired his ability to learn novel relations,  while additional damage to ventromedial prefrontal and anterior temporal regions may  have resulted in an inability to use prior knowledge to flexibly express indirect  relational knowledge.","2016-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","170-184","","2","26","","Hippocampus","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 26234960  PMCID: PMC5014178","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; aging; Young Adult; Aging/*metabolism/*psychology; amnesia; Amnesia/*metabolism/*psychology; hippocampus; Hippocampus/*metabolism; Learning/*physiology; memory; Photic Stimulation/methods; semantic knowledge; transitivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a nested, longitudinal matched (on age, sex, surgery type, baseline cognition, vascular comorbidity, and Apolipoprotein E genotype) case-control study: delirium cases and no-delirium controls were selected from the overall cohort (N = 566; 24% delirium). Analyses were independently conducted in discovery, replication, and pooled cohorts (39, 36, 75 matched pairs, respectively). Nonparametric signed-rank tests evaluating differences in cytokine levels between matched pairs were used to identify delirium-associated cytokines.Results: In the discovery and replication cohorts, matching variables were similar in cases and controls. Compared to controls, cases had (*p < .05, **p < .01) significantly higher interleukin-6 on POD2 in the discovery, replication, and pooled cohorts (median difference [pg/mL] 50.44**, 20.17*, 39.35**, respectively).

SETTING: Community-dwellers across England.  PARTICIPANTS: Respondents to the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing, waves 4 and  5. RESULTS: (Confidence level at 95% or higher, except when stated): ▸ Higher risk  drinking falls with age and there is a non-linear association between age and risk  for men, peaking in their mid-60s. ▸ Retirement and income are positively associated  with a higher risk for women but not for men. ▸ Education and smoking are positively  associated for both sexes. ▸ Loneliness and depression are not associated. ▸ Caring  responsibilities reduce risk among women. ▸ Single, separated or divorced men show a  greater risk of harmful drinking (at 10% confidence level). ▸ For women, being  younger and having a higher income at baseline increase the probability of becoming  a higher risk alcohol drinker over time. ▸ For men, not eating healthily, being  younger and having a higher income increase the probability of becoming a higher  risk alcohol drinker. Furthermore, the presence of children living in the household,  being lonely, being older and having a lower income are associated with ceasing to  be a higher risk alcohol drinker over time.

Protein and energy intakes are important determinants of muscle mass and MS maintenance and indirectly affect FC. The study sought to determine whether low protein and energy intakes were associated with FC decline and whether this association was mediated by MS in diabetic OA over a 3-year follow-up, in secondary analyses of the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging. Methods: In 172 diabetic OA (62 % men, mean age = 75 years), FC decline was defined as the change between SMAF (Système de Mesure de l'Autonomie Fonctionnelle) scores at baseline (T1) and 3 years later (T4). Baseline adequate protein and energy intakes were set at ≥1 g/kg BW and ≥30 kcal/kg BW, respectively. Sex-stratified linear regressions were controlled for confounding variables. Results: Mean body weight (BW) was 85.42 ± 13.8 in men and 79.7 ± 11.5 in women ( p ≤ .001). Adequate protein intake in women was associated with lesser FC decline (mean ± SE) (2.11 ± 0.81 vs. 4.91 ± 0.72; p = .029), while adequate energy intake was not associated with FC decline either in men or in women. In women, 1 g protein/kg BW helped maintain MS, hence minimizing FC decline. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that protein intake is important in maintaining FC in diabetic OA, albeit with sex differences. This study provides further evidence that protein requirements may be greater than the 0.8 g/kg BW currently recommended for OA. Future research in larger samples over longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results.","2016-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:52:48","","1729-1739","","4","55","","European Journal of Nutrition","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 26179475","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Body Weight; Fasting; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; P-Value; Scales; T-Tests; *Diet; Linear Models; *Energy Intake; Aging/*physiology; Muscle Strength/physiology; Quebec; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*physiopathology; Diabetic older adults; Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage; Dietary Fats/administration & dosage; Dietary Proteins/*administration & dosage; Energy intake; Functional capacity; Protein intake; Questionnaires; Random Sample; Secondary Analysis; Data Analysis Software; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Linear Regression; Mann-Whitney U Test; Epidemiological Research; Community Living -- In Old Age; Geriatric Nutrition; Nutritional Assessment -- In Old Age; Sex Factors -- In Old Age; Nonexperimental Studies; Blood Glucose -- In Old Age; Body Weight -- In Old Age; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -- In Old Age; Dietary Proteins -- In Old Age; Dietary Reference Intakes -- In Old Age; Energy Intake -- In Old Age; Muscle Strength -- In Old Age; Nutritional Requirements -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study investigated  the risk factors associated with prevalent and incident thyrotoxicosis and the  initiation of thyroid hormone therapy in a healthy, aging cohort. METHODS: A total  of 1450 ambulatory community volunteer participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal  Study of Aging examined at the NIA Clinical Research Unit in Baltimore, MD, have  undergone longitudinal monitoring of serum thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone  (free thyroxine and free triiodothryonine) levels as well as medication use every  one to four years, depending on age, between 2003 and 2014. RESULTS: The prevalence  of low TSH was 9.6% for participants on thyroid hormone and 0.8% for nontreated  individuals (p < 0.001). New cases occurred at a rate of 17.7/1000 person-years of  exposure to thyroid hormone therapy [CI 9-32/1000] and 1.5/1000 person-years in the  unexposed population [CI 0.7-2.9/1000]. Women were more likely to be treated and  more often overtreated than men were. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for  thyrotoxicosis between treated and untreated women was 27.5 ([CI 7.2-105.4];  p < 0.001) and 3.8 for men ([CI 1.2-6.3]; p < 0.01). White race/ethnicity and older  age were risk factors for thyroid hormone therapy but not overtreatment. Body mass  index was not associated with starting therapy (HR = 1.0). Thyroid hormone  initiation was highest among women older than 80 years of age (3/100 person-years).  For one-third of treated participants with follow-up data, overtreatment persisted  at least two years. CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis accounts for  approximately half of both prevalent and incident low TSH events in this  community-based cohort, with the highest rates among older women, who are vulnerable  to atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis. Physicians should be particularly cautious  in treating subclinical hypothyroidism in elderly women in light of recent studies  demonstrating no increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity or death for individuals  with elevated TSH levels <10 mIU/L.","2015-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:27:03","","979-986","","9","25","","Thyroid","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26177259  PMCID: PMC4560848","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Ethnic Groups; Prevalence; *Aging; Proportional Hazards Models; Healthy Volunteers; Baltimore; Atrial Fibrillation/complications; Bone Density/drug effects; Thyroid Hormones/*therapeutic use; Thyrotoxicosis/etiology/*prevention & control; Thyrotropin/blood; Thyroxine/blood; Triiodothyronine/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The  consequences of falls have detrimental impact on mobility. Hence, ascertaining  factors explaining variation among individuals' quality of life is critical for  promoting healthy ageing, particularly among older fallers. Hence, the primary  objective of our study was to identify key factors that explain variation in HRQoL  among community dwelling older adults at risk of falls. METHODS: We conducted a  longitudinal analysis of a 12-month prospective cohort study at the Vancouver Falls  Prevention Clinic (n = 148 to 286 depending on the analysis). We constructed linear  mixed models where assessment month (0, 6, 12) was entered as a within-subjects  repeated measure, the intercept was specified as a random effect, and predictors and  covariates were entered as between-subjects fixed effects. We also included the  predictors by sex and predictor by sex by time interaction terms in order to  investigate sex differences in the relations between the predictor variable and the  outcome variable, the EQ-5D. RESULTS: Our primary analysis demonstrated a  significant mobility (assessed using the Short Performance Physical Battery and the  Timed Up and Go) by time interaction (p < 0.05) and mobility by time by sex  interaction (p < 0.05). The sensitivity analyses demonstrated some heterogeneity of  these findings using an imputed and a complete case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Mobility  may be an important predictor of changes in HRQoL over time. As such, mobility is a  critical factor to target for future intervention strategies aimed at maintaining or  improving HRQoL in late life.","2015-07-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:31:03","","101","","","13","","Health Qual Life Outcomes","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26168922  PMCID: PMC4501103","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; *Health Status; *Mobility Limitation; *Quality of Life; Mobility Limitation; Residence Characteristics; Accidental Falls/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data; British Columbia/epidemiology; British Columbia -- epidemiology; Accidental Falls -- statistics & numerical data; Accidental Falls -- prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the frequency of  physical activity often declines with age, particularly among the elderly. Thus, we  investigated the effects of daily walking on mortality among younger-elderly men  (65-74 years) with or without major critical diseases (heart disease,  cerebrovascular disease, or cancer). METHODS: We assessed 1239 community-dwelling  men aged 64/65 years from the New Integrated Suburban Seniority Investigation  Project. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and 95% confidence  intervals (CIs) according to daily walking duration and adjusted for potential  confounders, including survey year, marital status, work status, education, smoking  and drinking status, BMI, regular exercise, regular sports, sleeping time, medical  status, disease history, and functional capacity. RESULTS: For men without critical  diseases, mortality risk declined linearly with increased walking time after  adjustment for confounders (Ptrend = 0.018). Walking ≥2 hours/day was significantly  associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.90). For men with  critical diseases, walking 1-2 hours/day showed a protective effect on mortality  compared with walking <0.5 hours/day after adjustment for confounders (HR 0.29; 95%  CI, 0.06-1.20). Walking ≥2 hours/day showed no benefit on mortality in men with  critical diseases, even after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Different  duration of daily walking was associated with decreased mortality for  younger-elderly men with or without critical diseases, independent of  sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, BMI, medical status, disease history, and  functional capacity. Incorporating regular walking into daily lives of  younger-elderly men may improve longevity and successful aging.","2015","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","609-616","","10","25","","J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26155815  PMCID: PMC4626390","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Japan/epidemiology; Mortality/*trends; Walking/*statistics & numerical data; Cerebrovascular Disorders/*epidemiology; Heart Diseases/*epidemiology; Neoplasms/*epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The secondary  aim was to investigate the link between TBS and conventional parameters of bone and  body composition by DXA. METHODS: 250 individuals of 5 age bands (spanning from 18  to 70 years of age, equally distributed for both age and sex) were prospectively  recruited. A lumbar spine (LS) DXA scan (Lunar iDXA™; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI)  was acquired for each subject and then analysed with the latest version of TBS  iNsight v. 2.1 (Med-Imaps, Pessac, France) software. LS bone mineral density (LS  BMD), Z-score, T-score and TBS values were collected. Pearson's test was used to  investigate the correlations between TBS and LS BMD and the influence of age, body  mass index (BMI) and body composition on these parameters. RESULTS: A significant  decrease of TBS and LS BMD was observed with ageing in both males (TBS mean values  from 1.486 to 1.374; LS BMD mean values from 1.219 to 1.187) and females (TBS mean  values from 1.464 to 1.306; LS BMD mean values from 1.154 to 1.116). No  statistically significant difference was achieved among males and females of the  same age group for both TBS and LS BMD, with the exception of the fifth age group. A  significant correlation was found between LS BMD and TBS values in both sexes (r  = 0.555-0.655, p < 0.0001). BMI influenced LS BMD but not TBS. TBS values were  inversely correlated with some fat mass parameters, in particular with visceral  adipose tissue (in males: r = -0.332, p < 0.001; in females: r = -0.348,  p < 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between TBS and total lean mass,  opposite to LS BMD (in males: r = 0.418; p < 0.0001; in females: r = -0.235;  p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This report is an attempt to start building a database for  healthy Italian people providing age- and sex-specific reference curves for TBS.  This could help clinicians to improve patient management in the detection of  impaired bone mineral status and to monitor bone changes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The  study reports TBS values of a selectively enrolled Italian healthy population,  ranging from younger to older ages and including males as a reference standard.  Moreover, links between body composition and TBS are explored.","2015-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","20140865","","1052","88","","Br J Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 26148778  PMCID: PMC4651387","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; Healthy Volunteers; Aging/*physiology; Bone Density/*physiology; Age Distribution; Absorptiometry, Photon/methods; Lumbar Vertebrae/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SETTING: NuAge  is a 5-year (2003-08) observational study of 1,793 men and women aged 67 to 84 in  good general health at recruitment. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 1,789 was used to  determine internal consistency of the questionnaire. A subsample (n = 94) of the  cohort who underwent a clinical test directly measuring masticatory efficiency was  used to determine criterion validity of the questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The  questionnaire was a subset of the Oral Health Impact Profile containing 7  Likert-scale questions (score 0-28 points). Masticatory efficiency was assessed  using a validated clinical test measuring ability to chew a raw carrot (Swallowing  Threshold Test Index, score 0-100%). For perceived and measured data, a higher score  indicated better masticatory efficiency. RESULTS: Internal consistency of the  questionnaire was deemed good (Cronbach alpha = 0.803). Mean scores were generally  high (men, 25.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 24.7-25.9; women, 24.3, 95%  CI = 23.7-25.0), indicating good perceived masticatory efficiency for men and women.  Mean performance test scores were low (men, 60.8%, 95% CI = 57.3-64.2; women, 61.2%,  95% CI = 57.7-64.7).

While cross-sectional studies reveal  associations between odor identification and measures of episodic memory, processing  speed, and executive function, longitudinal studies so far have been ambiguous with  regard to demonstrating that odor identification may be predictive of decline in  cognitive function. METHOD: One hundred and 7 healthy aging individuals (average age  60.2 years, 71% women) were assessed with an odor identification test and  nonolfactory cognitive measures of verbal episodic memory, mental processing speed,  executive function, and language 3 times, covering a period of 6.5 years. RESULTS:  The cross-sectional results revealed odor identification performance to be  associated with age, measures of verbal episodic memory, and processing speed. Using  linear mixed models, the longitudinal analyses revealed age-associated decline in  all measures. Controlling for retest effects, the analyses demonstrated that gender  was a significant predictor for episodic memory and mental processing speed. Odor  identification performance was further shown to be a significant predictor for  episodic verbal memory. CONCLUSION: This study shows age-related decline in odor  identification as well as nonolfactory cognitive measures. The finding showing that  odor identification is a significant predictor for verbal episodic memory is of  great clinical interest as odor identification has been suggested as a sensitive  measure of incipient pathologic cognitive decline.","2016-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","87-97","","1","30","","Neuropsychology","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 26076320","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Linear Models; *Cognition; *Aging/psychology; *Memory, Episodic; *Executive Function; Cognition Disorders/*psychology; *Odorants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are few examples of a priori application of SA models in real world contexts using external validation procedures. The current study aims to establish the predictive validity of an a priori, continuous model of SA with respect to service utilization.Methods: Individuals (n = 740; 64.2% female) aged 65 years and over (mean 75.9; SD 6.2), randomly selected from general practitioner registries in five sites across the United Kingdom included in the second and third combined screen and assessment waves of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study (MRC CFAS; a longitudinal population-based cohort study) comprised the baseline and two-year follow-up in the current study. A Successful Aging Index (SAI) was created using items identified by systematic reviews of operational definitions and lay perspectives of SA, capturing physiological and psychosocial components. Demographic data and SAI components were collected at baseline. Outcome measures, i.e. health service use, informal care use, and functional service, were captured at two years follow-up.Results: Logistic regression revealed significant relationships between the SAI and six of eight service use outcomes in models adjusted for age, sex, education, and socio-economic status. Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated sufficient predictive capabilities for all models, (range 0.65-0.86).Conclusions: The SAI demonstrated a strong association, and predictive accuracy, with respect to service use, providing preliminary support for the practical utility and usefulness of this measure.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:22:43","","1971-1977","","12","27","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25990513","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Cognition; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; United Kingdom; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; healthy aging; *Cognition; *Health Status; Aging/*psychology; ROC Curve; successful aging; Quality of Life/*psychology; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; health service use; model development; predictive validity; Geriatric Assessment -- methods; Quality of Life -- psychology; Great Britain; Logistic Regression; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Geriatric Assessment -- Methods; Outcome Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological testing, including standardized  assessments of memory, divided and sustained attention, speed of mental processing,  verbal fluency, working memory, language, and an overall measure of premorbid  cognitive functioning, was performed 2 to 4 weeks before surgery. The relationship  between the individual neuropsychological tests and delirium status was examined  using linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Study  participants were generally highly educated (mean years of education 15.0±2.9), with  minimal or no cognitive impairment (mean Modified Mini-Mental State Examination  score 93.2 out of 100).

A healthy lifestyle that includes  sufficient physical activity as well as a balanced and diverse diet contributes to  healthy aging. One key factor that elderly people need to be aware of is compliance  with nutritional recommendations. There is very little data concerning eating  patterns, consumption behavior, and compliance with food guides (food pyramid) and  nutritional recommendations among the Swiss, particularly for the middle-aged and  elderly. The objective of this study was to gather new and representative  information about these issues, concentrating on people aged 50+ and living in  Switzerland. METHODS: A questionnaire in online and written form was distributed to  a representative sample of middle-aged and elderly people living in Switzerland.  RESULTS: In total, 632 people returned the survey. Of those respondents, 71% knew  the Swiss Food Pyramid but only 38% said they comply with it. Based on self-reports,  only a few participants met the recommendations for the different food groups listed  in the food pyramid, whether in the pyramid-comply or pyramid-non-comply group.  CONCLUSION: The survey shows that the middle-aged and elderly living in Switzerland  need more nutritional guidance to help them to meet dietary recommendations. As  usage and understanding of food guides seem limited among this population group, new  tools must be explored for transfer of recommendations to real applications.","2016-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","638-644","","3","35","","Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men,  Uppsala, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Swedish men investigated in 1970-74 (aged 48.6-51.1)  and followed up for four decades (N=2,293). MEASUREMENTS: Conventional  cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index (BMI), and dietary biomarkers were  measured, and a questionnaire was used to gather information on lifestyle variables  at age 50. Four hundred seventy-two men were reinvestigated in 2008-09 (aged  84.8-88.9). Independent aging was defined as survival to age 85, Mini-Mental State  Examination score of 25 or greater, not living in an institution, independent in  personal care and hygiene, able to walk outdoors without personal help, and no  diagnosis of dementia. The National Swedish Death Registry provided survival data.  RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of the cohort survived to age 85. Seventy-four percent  of the participants in 2008-09 were aging independently. In univariable analyses,  high leisure-time physical activity predicted survival but not independent aging.  Low work-time physical activity was associated more strongly with independent aging  (odds ratio (OR)=1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-2.88) than with survival  (OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.05-1.52). In multivariable analyses, midlife BMI was negatively  associated (OR=0.80/SD, 95% CI=0.65-0.99/SD), and never or former smoking was  positively associated (OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.07-2.59), with independent aging. As  expected, conventional cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors were associated  with mortality. CONCLUSION: A normal midlife BMI and not smoking were associated  with independent aging close to four decades later, indicating that normal weight at  midlife has the potential not only to increase survival, but also to preserve  independence with aging.","2015-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","877-885","","5","63","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","© 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2015, The American Geriatrics Society.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25919442","","","","Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Survival Rate; *Aging; *Independent Living; Sweden; successful aging; longitudinal; obesity; smoking; independent aging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Older age at first birth was associated with a lower likelihood of HBP in women aged 25 to <35 years and 35 to 45 years at first birth (in women currently <60 years) and 35 to 45 years at first birth (in women currently ≥60 years of age), compared with women aged 18 to <25 years at first birth, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors.Women who were older when they gave first birth had lower odds of treatment for HBP compared with women who were younger when they gave birth to their first child. The contribution of a woman's pregnancy history, including her age at first birth, should be discussed with a patient when assessing her risk of HBP.","2015-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:38:25","","1","","16","94","","Medicine (Baltimore)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25906097  PMCID: PMC4602690","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Body Mass Index; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Health Behavior; Prevalence; Age Factors; Odds Ratio; Hypertension -- epidemiology; Australia/epidemiology; Hypertension/*epidemiology; Breast Feeding; Pregnancy/*statistics & numerical data; Australia -- epidemiology; Pregnancy -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Grandparenting is an increasingly popular form of childcare that provides  social activity for older adults. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between  grandparenting, as a form of social engagement, and cognitive function in adults  aged over 65, a decade after our previous work. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were 224  Australian women (mean age=70) from the longitudinal prospective Women's Healthy  Ageing Project (WHAP). Cognitive function was assessed using a neuropsychological  battery consisting of previously validated measures including the California Verbal  Learning Test, Digit Span task, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test.  Individual test scores were combined using factor analysis into executive function  and episodic memory scores. RESULTS: Grandmothers minding grandchildren had higher  executive function than those who were not minding grandchildren or who did not have  grandchildren (p<0.05). Minding grandchildren for one day per week predicted better  executive function performance than more frequent grandparenting (p<0.05),  consistent with previous findings. CONCLUSIONS: While grandparenting is associated  with better executive function overall, highly frequent grandparenting is associated  with lower executive function, which may be due to demands. Social engagement  comprises various aspects which need to be taken into consideration when studying  cognition.","2015-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","317-322","","2","81","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) markers of neuronal injury or neurodegeneration may offer usefulness in  predicting disease progression and guiding outcome assessments and prognostic  decisions in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies. Visinin-like protein 1  (VILIP-1) has demonstrated potential usefulness as a marker of neuronal injury in  AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usefulness of CSF VILIP-1, tau, p-tau181, and Aβ42  levels in predicting rates of whole-brain and regional atrophy in early AD and  cognitively normal control subjects over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Longitudinal observational study of brain atrophy in participants with early AD and  cognitively normal controls. Study participants had baseline CSF biomarker  measurements and longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging assessments for a mean  follow-up period of 2 to 3 years. Mixed linear models assessed the ability of  standardized baseline CSF biomarker measures to predict rates of whole-brain and  regional atrophy over the follow-up period. The setting was The Charles F. and  Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University School of  Medicine in St Louis. Participants (mean age, 72.6 years) were individuals with a  clinical diagnosis of very mild AD (n = 23) and cognitively normal controls (n = 64)  who were enrolled in longitudinal studies of healthy aging and dementia. The study  dates were 2000 to 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correlations between baseline  CSF biomarker measures and rates of whole-brain or regional atrophy in the AD and  control cohorts over the follow-up period. RESULTS: Baseline CSF VILIP-1, tau, and  p-tau181 levels (but not Aβ42 levels) predicted rates of whole-brain and regional  atrophy in AD over the follow-up period. Baseline CSF VILIP-1 levels predicted  whole-brain (P = .006), hippocampal (P = .01), and entorhinal (P = .001) atrophy  rates at least as well as tau and p-tau181 in early AD. Cognitively normal controls  whose CSF VILIP-1, tau, or p-tau181 levels were in the upper tercile had higher  rates of whole-brain (P = .02, P = .003, and P = .02, respectively), hippocampal (P  = .001, P = .01, and P = .02, respectively), and entorhinal (P = .007, P = .01, and  P = .01, respectively) atrophy compared with those whose levels were in the lower 2  terciles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid VILIP-1 levels predict  rates of whole-brain and regional atrophy similarly to tau and p-tau181 and may  provide a useful CSF biomarker surrogate for neurodegeneration in early symptomatic  and preclinical AD.","2015-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","656-665","","6","72","","JAMA Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25867677  PMCID: PMC4551490","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Brain/*pathology; tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid; Severity of Illness Index; Atrophy/pathology; Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid; Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid; Peptide Fragments/cerebrospinal fluid; Alzheimer Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology; Neurocalcin/*cerebrospinal fluid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: to identify the socio-demographic, social connectedness, physical environment and physical and mental health-related factors associated with PA. Setting and participants: adults aged 65 and over living in the community (n = 3499). Methods: this study used a cross-sectional design. Self-report, interview and physical assessment were the data collection methods used. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form) measured PA in metabolic equivalents.

In order of strength of relationship, the β coefficients, the variables time spent sitting, gender, quality of life, grip test, disability, age, depression, BMI, anxiety, employment, member of a non-church club, type of house and cognitive ability were significant factors associated with PA. Conclusion: from a range of 40 original variables, this study identified the variables most strongly related to PA were not physical health or physical environment. They included modifiable variables, such as time spent sitting and mental health, which can be actively targeted in policy and practice. They also included non-modifiable variables such as gender and age that can be addressed through increased awareness and targeted health promotion.","2015-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:39:05","","586-592","","4","44","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2015.

There is considerable evidence that surviving partners report substantial changes in their wellbeing and mental health. Changes can occur prior to partner's death as an anticipatory effect and consequently during the period after partner's death. For most, declines in wellbeing and mental health dissipate over time. However, there is a limited long-term evidence to compare age-normative trajectories in mental health and wellbeing with the trajectories of those who transition into widowhood.Methods: Participants (n = 652) were older adults (aged 65-94 years at baseline) from the 16-year Melbourne Longitudinal Studies on Healthy Ageing project who were either married or de facto (n = 577), or recently widowed (n = 75). Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) examined the immediate and long-term impact of widowhood. GEE piecewise regression analyses examined the trajectories of wellbeing and mental health in those who transitioned into widowed with time centered at time of partner's death. Analyses were stratified by gender.Results: For both men and women, becoming widowed was strongly related to a strong decline in positive affect post partner's death. Otherwise, no long-term impact of widowhood on negative affect or depressive symptomology was reported.Conclusions: The impact of widowhood reports differential impacts on different indicators of wellbeing and mental health, which were inconsistent between men and women.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:56:14","","1979-1986","","12","27","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25851736","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Bereavement; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Australia; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; *Depression; longitudinal studies; Quality of Life/*psychology; *Mental Health; Depression; *Bereavement; Widowhood/*psychology; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; depression; bereavement; Victoria; wellbeing; Regression; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Widows and Widowers -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tests of executive function,  processing speed and verbal episodic memory were also administered at follow-up.  Analyses of co-variance were performed to evaluate the associations between BP  categories and cognitive performance. RESULTS: prehypertensive BP at age 50 years is  a significant predictor of reduced processing speed and verbal episodic memory a  decade later. Cross-sectional measurements at age 60 years showed that untreated  hypertensive women performed significantly worse on verbal episodic memory compared  with their prehypertensive peers.

There has been enormous growth in participation at  Masters events, and older athletes have been competing at the highest levels with  much younger athletes. However, the progression of athletic performance over time  has not been well investigated in Masters athletes. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To  determine whether older Masters athletes improved athletic performance over time,  running and swimming times from 1975 to 2013 were collected biennially. The running  event of 100 m was chosen specifically, as it is one of the most popular track and  field events that would have attracted a large number of competitors. The middle  distance of 400 m as well as 100 m freestyle swimming were also examined to  determine whether the results in 100 m sprint event can be confirmed in other  events. RESULTS: The improvements in fastest 100 m running times over time were not  significant. However, all the Masters age-group records improved significantly over  time. The slopes of improvements over the years were progressively greater at older  age groups with the greatest progression observed at oldest age groups of 75-79  years examined. The general trends were similar for 400 m middle-distance running  and 100 m freestyle swimming. CONCLUSIONS: While younger athletes' performance has  stagnated, Masters athletes improved their athletic performance significantly and  progressively over the years. The magnitude of improvements was greater in older age  groups gradually closing the gap in athletic performance between younger and older  participants.","2015-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","683-686","","4","44","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2015.

DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective analysis of the adaptive response to 12  (n = 110) and 24 (n = 85) weeks of supervised resistance-type exercise training in  older (>65 years) men and women. MEASUREMENTS: Lean body mass (DXA), type I and type  II muscle fiber size (biopsy), leg strength (1-RM on leg press and leg extension),  and physical function (chair-rise time) were assessed at baseline, and after 12 and  24 weeks of resistance-type exercise training. RESULTS: Lean body mass increased by  0.9 ± 0.1 kg (range: -3.3 to +5.4 kg; P < .001) from 0 to 12 weeks of training. From  0 to 24 weeks, lean body mass increased by 1.1 ± 0.2 kg (range: -1.8 to +9.2 kg; P <  .001).

Chair-rise time decreased by 1.3 ± 0.4  seconds (range: +21.6 to -12.5 seconds; P = .003) from 0 to 12 weeks. From 0 to 24  weeks, chair-rise time decreased by 2.3 ± 0.4 seconds (range: +10.5 to -23.0  seconds; P < .001). Nonresponsiveness was not apparent in any subject, as a positive  adaptive response on at least one training outcome was apparent in every subject.  CONCLUSIONS: A large heterogeneity was apparent in the adaptive response to  prolonged resistance-type exercise training when changes in lean body mass, muscle  fiber size, strength, and physical function were assessed in older men and women.  The level of responsiveness was strongly affected by the duration of the exercise  intervention, with more positive responses following more prolonged exercise  training. We conclude that there are no nonresponders to the benefits of  resistance-type exercise training on lean body mass, fiber size, strength, or  function in the older population. Consequently, resistance-type exercise should be  promoted without restriction to support healthy aging in the older population.","2015-05-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:27:15","","400-411","","5","16","","J Am Med Dir Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

However, the existing discoveries are still  inconsistent, which may be attributed largely to the heterogeneous measures and  methods scholars used and to the unidirectional causalities presumed in most  research. This study addresses these gaps by using more-refined measures to explore  whether the network types have differential impacts on older adults' health  outcomes, and whether a reverse causal relationship exists between older adults'  health conditions and the network types they adopted. Using data from three recent  waves (2005, 2008, and 2012) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n  = 4190), we constructed four network types using the K-means clustering method  (i.e., diverse, friend, family, and restricted), and examined their impacts on a  variety of health outcomes (i.e., physical, cognitive, psychological, and overall  well-being). Our results demonstrate that there are strong reciprocal associations  between these two factors. On the one hand, a diverse network type yielded the most  beneficial health outcomes as measured by multiple health indicators, and the  friend-focused network type is more beneficial than the family-focused network type  in physical outcomes but not in psychological outcomes. On the other hand, we found  that a decrease in all health indicators leads to withdrawal from more-beneficial  network types such as a diversified network type, and a shift to less-beneficial  network types such as family-focused or restricted networks. The understanding of  this reciprocal association could encourage programs designed to enhance healthy  aging to focus on improving the bridging social capital of older adults so that they  can break the vicious cycle between network isolation and poor health conditions.","2015-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:56:54","","59-68","","","130","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Japan provides a compelling context to test this hypothesis due to its rapidly growing elderly population and the phenomenal health of the population. Using the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging, this study examines how social participation, measured by group membership, is related to the risk of overall mortality among Japanese elders aged 65 and older. Results from Cox proportional hazards models show that group affiliation confers advantages against mortality risk, even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, physical health measures, and family relationship variables. In particular, activities geared more toward self-development, such as postretirement employment and lifelong learning, are strongly associated with lower levels of mortality. Findings suggest that continued social participation at advanced ages produces positive health consequences, highlighting the importance of active aging in achieving successful aging in the Japanese context.","2015-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:19:55","","481-499","","5","37","","Res Aging","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2014.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 25651580","","","","Aged; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Japan; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Human; aging; Proportional Hazards Models; older adults; *Longevity; *Health Behavior; Japan/epidemiology; mortality; Mortality/*trends; social participation; *Intergenerational Relations; Asian Continental Ancestry Group/*psychology/statistics & numerical data; Social Identification; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Membership; Mortality -- In Old Age; Social Participation -- In Old Age -- Japan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little research  has examined white matter abnormalities of other brain regions, including those  associated with visual processing, despite evidence that other brain abnormalities  appear in these regions in early disease stages. METHOD: Diffusion tensor imaging  (DTI) was utilized to examine participants (n = 44) that completed baseline imaging  as part of a longitudinal healthy aging study. Participants were divided into two  groups based on scores from the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief  screening tool for MCI. Participants who scored <26 were defined as ""probable MCI""  while those who scored ≥26 were labeled cognitively healthy. Two DTI indices were  analyzed including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). DTI values  for white matter in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, pericalcarine, fusiform gyrus, and  all four lobes were compared using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).  Regression analyses examined the relationship between DTI indices and total MoCA  score. RESULTS: RESULTS revealed significantly lower FA in the probable MCI group in  the cuneus, fusiform, pericalcarine, and occipital lobe, and significantly higher MD  in the temporal lobe. Fusiform FA and temporal lobe MD were significantly related to  total MoCA score after accounting for age and education. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS  indicate that there are posterior white matter microstructural changes in  individuals with probable MCI. These differences demonstrate that white matter  abnormalities are evident among individuals with probable MCI in regions beyond  those commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease and anterior brain aging  patterns.","2015","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:20:27","","61-69","","1","37","","J Clin Exp Neuropsychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25523313  PMCID: PMC4355053","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Regression Analysis; Multivariate Analysis; Cognitive Dysfunction/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; Anisotropy; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Mild cognitive impairment; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Diffusion tensor imaging; White Matter/*pathology; Fractional anisotropy; Occipital lobe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared the cognitive health  of older adults in New Zealand and the USA, and examined differences in known risk  factors. METHODS: Two nationally representative samples were derived from the 2010  waves of the New Zealand Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 953) and the US Health  and Retirement Study (HRS) (n = 3,746). Data from comparable measures of cognitive  function, gender, age, income, education, prevalence of cancer, diabetes, heart  disease, hypertension and stroke, exercise, alcohol consumption, smoker status,  depression, and self-reported health were subjected to hierarchical regression  analysis to examine how national differences in cognitive function might be  explained by differences in these risk factors. RESULTS: The New Zealand sample  scored 4.4 points higher on average than the US sample on the 43 point cognitive  scale. Regression analyses of the combined samples showed that poorer cognitive  health is more likely in those who are male, older, less educated, have suffered a  stroke, consume alcohol less frequently, are more depressed, and report worse  overall health. Controlling for age and sex reduced the mean difference to 2.6 and  controlling for risk factors further reduced it to 2.3. CONCLUSIONS: Older New  Zealand adults displayed better cognitive function than those in a US sample. This  advantage can be partially explained by age and sex differences and, to some extent,  by differences in known risk factors. However, the national advantage remained even  when all measured risk factors are statistically controlled.","2015-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","591-600","","4","27","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25486859","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Age Factors; United States/epidemiology; successful aging; New Zealand/epidemiology; Income/statistics & numerical data; Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects; Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology; Stroke/complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe associations of  dietary antioxidants with cognitive function in a large biracial population, while  testing moderation by sex, race, and age and mediation by depressive symptoms.  METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1274 adults (541 men and 733 women)  aged 30 to 64 years at baseline (mean [standard deviation] = 47.5 [9.3]) in the  Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Lifespan Study, Baltimore  city, MD. Cognitive performance in the domains of memory, language/verbal,  attention, spatial, psychomotor speed, executive function, and global mental status  were assessed. The 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was  used to measure depressive symptoms. Dietary intake was assessed with two 24-hour  recalls, estimating daily consumption of total carotenoids and vitamins A, C, and E  per 1000 kcal. RESULTS: Among key findings, 1 standard deviation (∼ 2.02 mg/1000  kcal) higher vitamin E was associated with a higher score on verbal memory,  immediate recall (β = +0.64 [0.19], p = .001), and better language/verbal fluency  performance (β = +0.53 [0.16], p = .001), particularly among the younger age group.  Women with higher vitamin E intake (β = +0.68 [0.21], p = .001) had better  performance on a psychomotor speed test. The vitamin E-verbal memory association was  partially mediated by depressive symptoms (proportion mediated = 13%-16%).

Although CD4+ T cells play an essential role in  many immune responses, few studies have directly assessed the effect of aging on the  balance between effector T (Teff) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here, we  determined if and how aging affects the ratio between Treg and Teff cells.  Percentages of both naive Treg (nTreg; CD45RA+CD25(int)FOXP3(low)) and memory Treg  (memTreg; CD45RA-CD25(high)FOXP3(high)) cells were determined by flow cytometry in  peripheral blood samples of healthy individuals of various ages (20-84 years).  Circulating Th1, Th2 and Th17 effector cells were identified by intracellular  staining for IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17, respectively, upon in vitro stimulation with PMA  and calcium ionophore. Whereas proportions of nTreg cells declined with age, memTreg  cells increased. Both Th1 and Th2 cells were largely maintained in the circulation  of aged humans, whereas Th17 cells were decreased. Similar to memTreg cells, the 3  Teff subsets resided primarily in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment. Overall,  Treg/Teff ratios were increased in the memory CD4+ T cell compartment of aged  individuals when compared to that of young individuals. Finally, the relative  increase of memTreg cells in elderly individuals was associated with poor responses  to influenza vaccination. Taken together, our findings imply that aging disturbs the  balance between Treg cells and Teff cells.","2014-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:42","","190-196","","","60","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation of flavonoid  intake in midlife with the prevalence of healthy aging. DESIGN: We included 13,818  women from the Nurses' Health Study with dietary data and no major chronic diseases  in 1984-1986 when they were aged in their late 50s (median age: 59 y); all women  provided information on multiple aspects of aging an average of 15 y later. Intakes  of 6 major flavonoid subclasses in midlife were ascertained on the basis of averaged  intakes of flavonoid-rich foods from 2 food-frequency questionnaires (1984-1986). We  defined healthy compared with usual aging as of age 70 y; healthy aging was based on  survival to ≥70 y with maintenance of 4 health domains (no major chronic diseases or  major impairments in cognitive or physical function or mental health). RESULTS: Of  women who survived until ≥70 y of age, 1517 women (11.0%) met our criteria for  healthy aging. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of intake, women in the  highest quintile of intake of several flavonoid subclasses at midlife had greater  odds of healthy aging. After multivariable adjustment, ORs were as follows:  flavones, 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.58); flavanone, 1.28 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.53);  anthocyanin, 1.25 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.50); and flavonol, 1.18 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.42) (all  P-trend ≤ 0.02). Consistently, greater intakes of major sources of these flavonoids  (i.e., oranges, berries, onions, and apples) were associated with increased odds of  healthy aging. We showed no association with flavan-3-ol monomers (P-trend = 0.80)  or polymers (P-trend = 0.63). CONCLUSION: Higher intake of flavonoids at midlife,  specifically flavones, flavanones, anthocyanins, and flavonols, is associated with  greater likelihood of health and wellbeing in individuals surviving to older ages.","2014-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:42:39","","1489-1497","","6","100","","Am J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 American Society for Nutrition.","","","","","","PMID: 25411284  PMCID: PMC4232017","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Cognition; Risk Factors; Female; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; P-Value; *Aging; Fruit; healthy aging; Chronic Disease; *Feeding Behavior; Citrus sinensis; cohort studies; flavonoid; Flavonoids/*administration & dosage; Malus; Onions; public health; risk factors in epidemiology; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36); Survival; Women's Health -- In Old Age; Interviews; Data Analysis Software; Nutritional Assessment; Nurses; Diet -- In Middle Age; Logistic Regression; Health Status -- Evaluation; Geriatric Nutrition; Reliability and Validity; Adolescence -- Evaluation; Apple; Berries; Flavanones; Flavones; Flavonoids -- Classification; Flavonoids -- In Middle Age; Orange; Survey Research; Two-Tailed Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies indicate that, after a period  of relative stability during adulthood, there is an accelerated decline in  anisotropy and increase in diffusivity values during senescence; and, spatially,  results have been discussed within the context of several anatomical frameworks.  However, inferring trajectories of change from cross-sectional data can be  challenging; and, as yet, there have been no longitudinal reports of the timescale  and spatial distribution of age-related white matter change in healthy adults across  the adult lifespan. In a longitudinal DTI study of 203 adults between 20 and 84  years of age, we used tract-based spatial statistics to characterize the pattern of  annual change in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and  mean diffusivity and examined whether there was an acceleration of change with age.  We found extensive and overlapping significant annual decreases in fractional  anisotropy, and increases in axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean  diffusivity. Spatially, results were consistent with inferior-to-superior gradients  of lesser-to-greater vulnerability. Annual change increased with age, particularly  within superior regions, with age-related decline estimated to begin in the fifth  decade. Charting white matter microstructural changes in healthy aging provides  essential context to clinical studies, and future studies should compare age  trajectories between healthy participants and at-risk populations and also explore  the relationship between DTI rates of change and cognitive decline.","2014-11-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","15425-15436","","46","34","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 the authors 0270-6474/14/3415425-12$15.00/0.","","","","","","PMID: 25392509  PMCID: PMC4228140","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Sex Characteristics; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; aging; *Aging; Young Adult; Neuroimaging; Healthy Volunteers; Anisotropy; longitudinal; *Diffusion Tensor Imaging; DTI; lifespan; white matter; White Matter/*anatomy & histology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This  study proposes an approach whereby structural and connectomic information can be  combined to estimate PBA as an early biomarker of brain aging. In a cohort of 136  healthy adults, magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor imaging are respectively  used to measure cortical thickness over the entire cortical mantle as well as  connectivity properties (mean connectivity density and mean fractional anisotropy)  for white matter connections. Using multivariate regression, these measurements are  then employed to (1) illustrate how CA can be predicated--and thereby also how PBA  can be estimated--and to conclude that (2) healthy aging is associated with  significant connectome changes during adulthood. Our study illustrates a  connectomically-informed statistical approach to PBA estimation, with potential  applicability to the clinical identification of patients who exhibit accelerated  brain aging, and who are consequently at higher risk for developing mild cognitive  impairment or dementia.","2015-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:53:30","","678-689","","4","9","","Brain Imaging Behav","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25376330  PMCID: PMC4424195","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- pathology; Female; Male; Aging; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Brain -- pathology; Prospective Studies; Multivariate Analysis; Funding Source; Human; Brain -- Pathology; Brain; Young Adult; Healthy aging; Aging/*pathology; Brain/growth & development/*pathology; Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods; Body Weights and Measures; Organ Size; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Mild cognitive impairment; Connectome/*methods; Connectome; Cortical thickness; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Multivariate regression; Physiological brain age; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods; Brain -- growth & development; Diffusion Tensor Imaging -- methods; Connectome -- methods; Middle Age; Adolescence; Data Analysis, Statistical; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Brain Mapping -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past decades, food consumption patterns and food availability have  also changed drastically, and therefore this study aimed to describe these changes  in an ageing population. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Food consumption of participants from the  Medical Research Council National Survey on Health and Development, a British birth  cohort study, was assessed using a 5-day estimated food records at 60-64 years  (2006-11), 53 years (1999), 43 years (1989) and 36 years (1982). Only those who  recorded ⩾3 days at all four time points were included in the analyses, n=989 (n=438  men and n=551 women); trends were tested using the Friedman test. RESULTS:  Consumption of white bread, whole milk, fats and oils, meat and meat products,  alcoholic drinks, coffee, sugar, preserves and confectionery decreased (P<0.001),  whereas consumption of wholemeal and granary bread, semi-skimmed milk, fish and  fruit and vegetables increased (P<0.001) over time. These observed changes in food  consumption reflect a healthier diet, for example, replacement of white bread by  granary and wholemeal bread, lower consumption of red and processed meats, somewhat  higher consumption of fish, higher consumption of vegetables and lower consumption  of coffee. This could partly be because of ageing of the cohort or compliance with  dietary recommendations, facilitated by greater availability of healthier foods,  such as semi-skimmed milk and wholegrain bread, in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: The changes  in food consumption in this British birth cohort over the past three decades are  encouraging and reflect a healthier diet in the later years.","2015-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:24:05","","817-823","","7","69","","Eur J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25351642  PMCID: PMC4926956","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet Records; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; United Kingdom; *Aging; Nutrition Surveys; Nutrition Policy; *Nutrition Policy; *Patient Compliance/ethnology; Diet/*adverse effects/ethnology/trends; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/ethnology; Diet -- trends; Diet -- adverse effects; Diet -- ethnology; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena -- ethnology; Patient Compliance -- ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Do the factors include income, health expenditure,  the use of mobile telephones, or sanitation? The survival probability of becoming a  centenarian (SPBC) is defined as an estimate of the production of centenarians by a  population. The SPBC (70) is the survival probability of becoming a centenarian for  those aged 70. This study estimates the associations between the SPBC (70), and the  gross national income, health expenditure, telecommunications, and sanitation  facilities in 32 countries. METHODS: The socioeconomic indicators for this study  were obtained from the database of the United Nations Development Programme. In  addition, the data for the analysis of centenarians in 32 countries were obtained  from the Human Mortality Database, which is maintained by the Department of  Demography at the University of California, Berkeley, USA, and the Max Planck  Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. Associations between  socioeconomic indicators and SPBC (70) were assessed using Pearson's correlation  coefficients and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Significant positive  correlations were found between the SPBC (70), and the socioeconomic factors of  gross national income (GNI), public expenditure on health as a percentage of gross  domestic product (PEHGDP), fixed and mobile telephone subscribers (FMTS) as the  standard of living, and improved sanitation facilities (ISF). Overall, the SPBC (70)  of female and male predictors were used, in order to form a model production of  centenarians, with higher GNI and PEHGDP, as well as higher FMTS and ISF as the  socioeconomic factors (R²= 0.422, P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The socioeconomic level in  all 32 countries appears to have an important latent effect on the production of  centenarians in both females and males. This study has identified the following four  important aspects of socioeconomic indicators in the survival probability of  becoming a centenarian for those aged 70: higher overall economic development level,  public expenditure on health, mobile telephone subscribers as the standard of  living, and the use of improved sanitation facilities for healthy aging. Thus, the  socioeconomic level seems to affect an important on the survival probability of  becoming a centenarian.","2014-10-21","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","113","","","14","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25332111  PMCID: PMC4216852","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Socioeconomic Factors; Global Health; Retrospective Studies; Longevity/*physiology; Life Expectancy/*trends; *Quality of Life; Income/*statistics & numerical data; Mortality/trends; Health Expenditures/*standards; Sanitation/*standards; Telephone/*statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: In 2010, a 2-year  follow-up study was conducted with the 2008 Montreal Neighborhood Networks and  Healthy Aging Study (MoNNET-HA) participants. We asked participants in 2008 and 2010  whether they had smoked in the past 30 days. Position and name generators were used  to collect data on social capital and social connections. We used multilevel  logistic analysis adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors to predict  smoking relapse in 2010.

Although arteries throughout the body are known to become stiffer with age, this vessel hardening is  believed to start at the level of the aorta and progress to other organs, including  the brain. Progression of this vascular impairment may contribute to cognitive  changes that arise with a similar time course during aging. Conversely, it has been  proposed that regular exercise plays a protective role, attenuating the impact of  age on vascular and metabolic physiology. Here, the impact of vascular degradation  in the absence of disease was investigated within 2 groups of healthy younger and  older adults. Age-related changes in executive function, elasticity of the aortic  arch, cardiorespiratory fitness, and cerebrovascular reactivity were quantified, as  well as the association between these parameters within the older group. In the  cohort studied, older adults exhibited a decline in executive functions, measured as  a slower performance in a modified Stroop task (1247.90 ± 204.50 vs. 898.20 ± 211.10  ms on the inhibition and/or switching component, respectively) than younger adults.  Older participants also showed higher aortic pulse wave velocity (8.98 ± 3.56 vs.  3.95 ± 0.82 m/s, respectively) and lower VO₂ max (29.04 ± 6.92 vs. 42.32 ± 7.31 mL  O2/kg/min, respectively) than younger adults. Within the older group, faster  performance of the modified Stroop task was associated with preserved aortic  elasticity (lower aortic pulse wave velocity; p = 0.046) and higher  cardiorespiratory fitness (VO₂ max; p = 0.036). Furthermore, VO₂ max was found to be  negatively associated with blood oxygenation level dependent cerebrovascular  reactivity to CO₂ in frontal regions involved in the task (p = 0.038) but positively  associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in periventricular watershed regions and  within the postcentral gyrus. Overall, the results of this study support the  hypothesis that cognitive status in aging is linked to vascular health, and that  preservation of vessel elasticity may be one of the key mechanisms by which physical  exercise helps to alleviate cognitive aging.","2015-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","304-314","","1","36","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

African Americans  (AAs) have a greater prevalence of iron deficiency compared with European Americans.  We conducted genome-wide admixture-mapping and association studies for serum iron,  serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (SAT) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC)  in 2347 AAs participating in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). Follow-up replication  analyses for JHS iron-trait associated SNPs were conducted in 329 AA participants in  the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS).  Higher estimated proportions of global African ancestry were significantly  associated with lower levels of iron (P = 2.4 × 10(-5)), SAT (P = 0.0019) and TIBC  (P = 0.042). We observed significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) between serum  TIBC levels and two independent SNPs around TF on chromosome 3, the first report of  a genome-wide significant second independent signal in this region, and SNPs near  two novel genes: HDGFL1 on chromosome 6 and MAF on chromosome 16. We also observed  significant associations between ferritin levels and SNPs near GAB3 on chromosome X.  We replicated our two independent associations at TF and our association at GAB3 in  HANDLS. Our study provides evidence for both shared and unique genetic risk factors  that are associated with iron-related measures in AAs.

This study hones  in on participation in productive activity, a factor that makes an important  contribution to successful aging. One conceptual model of productive activity in  later life specifies the antecedents and consequences of productivity. This study  draws on that micro-level model to develop a corresponding macro-level model and  assesses its utility for examining the predictors of and explaining the  relationships between one form of productivity (labor force participation rates) and  one aspect of well-being (average life expectancy) among males and females. DESIGN  AND METHODS: Random effects regression models and path analysis were used to analyze  cross-national longitudinal data for 24 high-income Organization for Economic  Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries at seven time points (1980-2010; 168  observations total). RESULTS: OECD countries with higher labor force participation  rates among older workers have higher life expectancies. Labor force participation  mediates the effects of gross domestic product per capita on male and female life  expectancy, and it mediates the effect of self-employment rate for men, but it acts  as a suppressor with regard to the effect of public spending on male and female life  expectancy. IMPLICATIONS: A well-known micro-level model of productive activity can  be fruitfully adapted to account for macro-level cross-national variation in  productivity and well-being.","2015-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","107-119","","1","55","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

However, evidence for associations with  measures of cognitive performance in adults without dementia has been mixed, as it  is for physical performance. Associations may also be evident in other genotypes  implicated in LDL-C levels. As part of the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course  (HALCyon) collaborative research programme, genotypic information was obtained for  APOE ε2/3/4, rs515135 (APOB), rs2228671 (LDLR) and rs629301 (SORT1) from eight  cohorts of adults aged between 44 and 90 + years. We investigated associations with  four measures of cognitive (word recall, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency and  search speed) and physical capability (grip strength, get up and go/walk speed,  timed chair rises and ability to balance) using meta-analyses. Overall, little  evidence for associations between any of the genotypes and measures of cognitive  capability was observed (e.g. pooled beta for APOE ε4 effect on semantic fluency z  score = -0.02; 95 % CI = -0.05 to 0.02; p value = 0.3; n = 18,796). However, there  was borderline evidence within studies that negative effects of APOE ε4 on nonverbal  ability measures become more apparent with age. Few genotypic associations were  observed with physical capability measures. The findings from our large  investigation of middle-aged to older adults in the general population suggest that  effects of APOE on cognitive capability are at most modest and are domain- and  age-specific, while APOE has little influence on physical capability. In addition,  other LDL-C-related genotypes have little impact on these traits.","2014","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9673","","4","36","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 25073452  PMCID: PMC4150901","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Phenotype; Cognition/*physiology; Aging/*genetics; *Polymorphism, Genetic; Alzheimer Disease/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology; Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics/metabolism; Cholesterol, LDL/*genetics/metabolism; DNA/*genetics; Walking/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In community surveys, older adults with this genotype  have been found to have lower scores on neuropsychological tests than those who do  not. It is possible that this is the consequence of subclinical changes in cognition  in those persons who later develop dementia. The aim of this research was to  determine whether the effect of APOE genotype on cognition would remain if those who  subsequently became demented were retrospectively removed from the analysis of the  baseline test data from a sample of healthy adults. METHOD: A sample of 241  nondemented persons over the age of 65 for whom APOE genotyping was available were  administered a range of neuropsychological tests at baseline and were followed up 10  years later. RESULTS: Significant differences between the ε4-present and ε4-absent  groups were found for the delayed recall trial of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning  Test and the Trail Making Test. When those participants known to have developed  dementia during the follow-up period were excluded from the analysis of the baseline  data these differences disappeared. A total of 113 nondemented survivors from the  original sample were retested, and no difference was found in the rate of decline on  any measure between the ε4-present and ε4-absent groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely  that the reported effect of the ε4 APOE genotype on cognition is the consequence of  the ε4-present group containing persons whose cognition is subtly affected by the  early stages of a dementing process. It is also unlikely that the presence of the ε4  allele by itself leads to a significantly accelerated rate of cognitive decline in  the nondemented elderly.","2014","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","742-750","","7","36","","J Clin Exp Neuropsychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 25026037","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Aging/*genetics; Apolipoprotein E4/*genetics; Trail Making Test; Apolipoprotein E; Cognition Disorders/*genetics; Older adult; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/glu094","","BACKGROUND: Hearing impairment (HI) is highly prevalent in older adults and is associated with social isolation, depression, and risk of dementia. Whether HI is  associated with broader downstream outcomes is unclear. We undertook this study to  determine whether audiometric HI is associated with mortality in older adults.  METHODS: Prospective observational data from 1,958 adults ≥70 years of age from the  Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study were analyzed using Cox proportional  hazards regression. Participants were followed for 8 years after audiometric  examination. Mortality was adjudicated by obtaining death certificates. Hearing was  defined as the pure-tone average of hearing thresholds in decibels re: hearing level  (dB HL) at frequencies from 0.5 to 4kHz. HI was defined as pure-tone average >25 dB  HL in the better ear. RESULTS: Of the 1,146 participants with HI, 492 (42.9%) died  compared with 255 (31.4%) of the 812 with normal hearing (odds ratio = 1.64, 95% CI:  1.36-1.98). After adjustment for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors, HI  was associated with a 20% increased mortality risk compared with normal hearing  (hazard ratio = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41). Confirmatory analyses treating HI as a  continuous predictor yielded similar results, demonstrating a nonlinear increase in  mortality risk with increasing HI (hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.00-1.29 per 10 dB  of threshold elevation up to 35 dB HL). CONCLUSIONS: HI in older adults is  associated with increased mortality, independent of demographics and cardiovascular  risk factors. Further research is necessary to understand the basis of this  association and whether these pathways might be amenable to hearing rehabilitation.","2015-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","85-90","","1","70","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

Hierarchical regression analyses showed that midlife memory ability, assessed 15-20  years earlier, explained at least as much variance as memory change in clusters in  the left inferior prefrontal cortex and the bilateral hippocampus, during memory  encoding. Furthermore, memory change estimates demonstrated higher sensitivity than  current memory levels in identifying distinct frontal regions where activity was  selectively related to age-related memory change, as opposed to midlife memory.  These findings highlight challenges in interpreting individual differences in  neurocognitive measures as age-related changes in the absence of longitudinal data  and also demonstrate the improved sensitivity of longitudinal measures.","2014-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2495-2503","","11","35","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is unclear whether positive  well-being is protective of another crucial component of healthy aging, cognitive  function, or whether it has a bidirectional relationship with cognitive function. We  use multilevel models with within-person centering to estimate the within- and  between-person association between cognitive function and positive well-being in 4  waves of data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), (N = 10985, aged  50-90 years at wave 1). Our findings show that, although most variation in cognitive  function was explained by age, and most variation in well-being was explained by  depression, small but significant associations between cognition and well-being  remained after variation in age and depression were controlled. In models where  cognition was the outcome, the association was mainly because of variation in mean  levels of well-being between persons. In models where well-being was the outcome,  the association was mainly because of within-person fluctuation in cognitive test  performance. Exercise and depression were the most important moderating influences  on the association between cognition and positive well-being. Depression had greater  effect upon this association for those with higher well-being, but exercise  protected cognitive performance against the adverse effects of lower well-being.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:40:39","","306-318","","2","29","","Psychol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","PMID: 24955999  PMCID: PMC4196750","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Health; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Personal Satisfaction; United Kingdom; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Cognition/*physiology; *Health; Aging/physiology/*psychology; *Personal Satisfaction; Depression/psychology; Exercise/physiology/psychology; Exercise Physiology; Middle Age; Great Britain; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Exercise -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Another aim was to study the relation  between the autonomic innervation and loss of secretory acinar cells in these  glands. METHODS: Labial salivary gland biopsies were taken from the lower lip from  190 men, born in 1953 and members of the Danish Metropolit birth cohort, who were  examined for age-related changes in cognitive function and dental health as part of  the Copenhagen University Center for Healthy Aging clinical neuroscience project.  The glands were routinely processed and semi-quantitatively analyzed for  inflammation, acinar atrophy, fibrosis, and adipocyte infiltration. Sections of  labial salivary gland tissue were stained with the panneuronal marker PGP 9.5. In a  subsample of 51 participants, the autonomic innervation of the glands was analyzed  quantitatively by use of stereology. RESULTS: Labial salivary gland tissue samples  from 33% of all participants displayed moderate to severe acinar atrophy and  fibrosis (31%). Xerostomia was not significantly associated with structural changes  of labial salivary glands, but in the subsample it was inversely related to the  total nerve length in the glandular connective tissue. Acinar atrophy and fibrosis  were negatively correlated with the parenchymal innervation and positively related  to diffuse inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study indicate  that aspects of the autonomic innervation of labial salivary glands may play a role  in the occurrence of xerostomia which in the present study group was not  significantly associated with degenerative changes in these glands. The findings  further indicate that the integrity of labial salivary gland acini is related to the  parenchymal autonomic innervation, whereas inflammatory processes may compromise it  by alternative mechanisms.","2014-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:54:21","","211-217","","","57","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the relationships among nutritional risk, self-rated health, and successful aging in community-dwelling Canadian older men. Methods: The surviving cohort of the Manitoba Follow-up Study (n=690, mean age = 86.8 years) were sent a self-administered nutrition survey in December 2007. The survey consisted of the Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition, version II (SCREEN II), a validated tool for assessing nutritional risk of cognitively intact community-living older adults, and questions about successful aging and health. Results: Of the 553 surveys returned (80% response), 522 with complete SCREEN II data were included in the analysis. Forty-four percent of respondents were at high nutritional risk, 24% were at moderate risk, and 32% were at low risk. Significant relationships were found between nutritional risk and self-rated health (P<0.0001) and successful aging (P=0.008), with greater nutritional risk associated with lower self-ratings of health and successful aging. Higher use of prescription medication was related to greater nutritional risk (P=0.004). Conclusions: Nutritional screening programs for community-dwelling older men are warranted as two-thirds of the study participants were at nutritional risk. Identifying older men at nutritional risk is a critical step in the process of nutritional assessment, and subsequent nutrition interventions and followup are required to prevent further health decline.","2014","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:25:33","","84-88","","2","75","","Can J Diet Pract Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Canada PMID: 24897014","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prevalence; Cardiovascular Diseases -- epidemiology; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Cardiovascular Diseases -- prevention & control; Military Personnel; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Univariate Statistics; Nutrition Surveys; *Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Diet/*adverse effects; Manitoba; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control; Malnutrition/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control; Manitoba/epidemiology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- etiology; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Diet -- adverse effects; Malnutrition -- epidemiology; Malnutrition -- etiology; Malnutrition -- prevention & control; Manitoba -- epidemiology; Questionnaires; Data Analysis Software; Statistical Significance; Logistic Regression; Body Mass Index -- In Old Age; Community Living -- In Old Age; Geriatric Nutrition; Nutritional Assessment -- In Old Age; Self Report -- In Old Age; Attitude to Aging -- Manitoba; Attitude to Health -- In Old Age; Drug Therapy -- In Old Age; Health Status -- In Old Age -- Manitoba; Men's Health -- In Old Age -- Manitoba; Nutrition Disorders -- Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Validity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certain factors-for example, living alone-may increase the risk for hospitalization, and their effect may be greater among persons with dementia and the old-old (aged 85+).Objectives: To determine the association of living alone and risk for hospitalization, and see if the observed effect is greater among persons with dementia or the old-old.Design: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study.Participants: 2,636 participants in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a longitudinal cohort study of dementia incidence. Participants were adults aged 65+ enrolled in an integrated health care system who completed biennial follow-up visits to assess for dementia and living situation.Main Measures: Hospitalization for all causes and for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) were identified using automated data.Key Results: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 75.5 years, 59 % were female and 36 % lived alone. Follow-up time averaged 8.4 years (SD 3.5), yielding 10,431 approximately 2-year periods for analysis. Living alone was positively associated with being aged 85+, female, and having lower reported social support and better physical function, and negatively associated with having dementia. In a regression model adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity burden, physical function and length of follow-up, living alone was not associated with all-cause (OR = 0.93; 95 % CI 0.84, 1.03) or ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) hospitalization (OR = 0.88; 95 % CI 0.73, 1.07).

AIM: This study aims to describe sexual function  of women in the late postmenopause and to investigate change from early  postmenopause. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2012/13 and longitudinal  analysis from 2002/04 of the population based, Australian cohort of the Women's  Healthy Ageing Project, applying validated instruments: Short Personal Experience  Questionnaire (SPEQ), Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, and California Verbal Learning Test.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sexual activity, SPEQ, and FSDS. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty  women responded (follow-up rate 53%), mean age was 70 years (range 64-77), 49.8%  were sexually active. FSDS scores showed more distress for sexually active women  (8.3 vs. 3.2, P<0.001). For 23 (23%) sexually active and for five (7%) inactive  women, the diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction could be made. After adjustment,  available partner (odds ratio [OR] 4.31, P<0.001), no history of depression (OR  0.49, P=0.036), moderate compared with no alcohol consumption (OR 2.43, P=0.019),  and better cognitive function score (OR1.09, P=0.050) were significantly predictive  for sexual activity. Compared with early postmenopause, 18% more women had ceased  sexual activity. For women maintaining their sexual activity through to late  postmenopause (n=82), SPEQ and FSDS scores had not changed significantly, but  frequency of sexual activity had decreased (P=0.003) and partner difficulties had  increased (P=0.043). [Correction added on 10 July 2014, after first online  publication: Mean age of respondents was added.] CONCLUSIONS: In late postmenopause,  half of the women were sexually active. Most important predictors were partner  availability and no history of depression. However, being sexually active or having  a partner were associated with higher levels of sexual distress. Compared with early  postmenopause, sexual function scores had declined overall but were stable for women  maintaining sexual activity. Further research into causes of sexual distress and  reasons for sexual inactivity at this reproductive stage is warranted.","2014-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2029-2038","","8","11","","J Sex Med","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 International Society for Sexual Medicine.","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 24888566","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Patient Satisfaction; Odds Ratio; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Postmenopause; Victoria/epidemiology; Depressive Disorder; Depressive Disorder/epidemiology; Female Sexual Dysfunction; Male Partner; Postmenopause/*psychology; Sexual Activity; Sexual Behavior/psychology/statistics & numerical data; Sexual Distress; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/*epidemiology/psychology; Sexual Partners/psychology; Sexuality; Spouse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also examined pathways that  connect social integration to better lung health. METHODS: High functioning men (n =  518) and women (n = 629) ages 70-79 were recruited as part of the MacArthur Study of  Successful Aging, and data were collected on social roles as well as pulmonary  function as assessed by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Multiple regressions  predicting PEFR from the number of social roles controlled for age, sex, race,  education, weight, and height. Physiological, behavioral, social, and psychological  factors were tested as mediators of the association between the number of social  roles and PEFR. RESULTS: More social roles were associated with better PEFR.  Analysis of specific roles indicated that marriage was the strongest positive  correlate of PEFR. However, greater numbers of roles were also associated with  better PEFR independent of marriage. Being a relative or friend were each also  individually associated with better PEFR. Even so, greater numbers of social roles  were associated with better PEFR independent of relative and friend. The data were  consistent with greater happiness, not smoking, and more physical activity acting as  pathways linking the number of roles to PEFR. CONCLUSIONS: Number of social roles is  an important correlate of healthy lung function in the elderly. This association may  be driven by healthier behaviors and greater feelings of well-being.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","535-543","","6","33","","Health Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","PMID: 24884907  PMCID: PMC4069253","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; *Interpersonal Relations; Peak Expiratory Flow Rate/*physiology; *Role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Daytime functioning was contrasted in three age  cohorts, across two parallel 4-night randomized groups (baseline, two nights of SWS  disruption or control, recovery sleep). SETTING: Sleep research laboratory.  PARTICIPANTS: 44 healthy young (20-30 y), 35 middle-aged (40-55 y), and 31 older  (66-83 y) men and women. INTERVENTIONS: Acoustic stimulation contingent on  appearance of slow waves. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Cognitive performance was  assessed before sleep latency tests at five daily time-points. SWS disruption  resulted in less positive affect, slower or impaired information processing and  sustained attention, less precise motor control, and erroneous implementation,  rather than inhibition, of well-practiced actions. These performance impairments had  far smaller effect sizes than the increase in daytime sleepiness and differed from  baseline to the same extent for each age group. At baseline, younger participants  performed better than older participants across many cognitive domains, with largest  effects on executive function, response time, sustained attention, and motor  control. At baseline, the young were sleepier than other age groups. CONCLUSIONS:  SWS has been considered a potential mediator of age-related decline in performance,  although the effects of SWS disruption on daytime functioning have not been  quantified across different cognitive domains nor directly compared to age-related  changes in performance. The data imply that two nights of SWS disruption primarily  leads to an increase in sleepiness with minor effects on other aspects of daytime  functioning, which are different from the substantial effects of age.","2014-06-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:46:29","","1127-1142","","6","37","","Sleep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24882908  PMCID: PMC4015387","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Memory; Polysomnography; Sleep Stages -- physiology; Prospective Studies; Arousal -- physiology; Psychomotor Performance -- physiology; Memory -- physiology; Psychomotor Performance; Attention -- physiology; Sleep -- physiology; Sleep Deprivation -- physiopathology; Reaction Time -- physiology; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; aging; cognition; Young Adult; Attention; Executive Function; Executive Function/physiology; Aging/*physiology; Attention/physiology; Memory/physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Affect/physiology; Sleep/*physiology; Acoustic Stimulation; Arousal/physiology; daytime functioning; sleep; Sleep Deprivation/*physiopathology; Sleep Stages/physiology; slow wave sleep; Wakefulness/*physiology; Affect; Executive Function -- physiology; Affect -- physiology; Wakefulness -- physiology; Middle Age; Sleep -- Physiology; Arousal -- Physiology; Reaction Time -- Physiology; Sleep Deprivation -- Physiopathology; Sleep Stages -- Physiology; Wakefulness -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior studies confirm that after experiencing childhood adversity, resilient adults can recover and engage in generative growth. This study explored the long-term effects of childhood adversity (assessed as harsh parenting and/or childhood poverty) on successful aging for individuals who either achieved or failed to achieve Erikson’s psychosocial developmental stage of generativity in midlife. Method. The study utilized a sample of 636 men from the Harvard Sample and Inner City Cohort of the 73-year longitudinal Study of Adult Development. Nested ordinary least squares regression models were used to test the mediating and moderating effects of midlife generativity on later life health and adjustment to aging. Results. Men who experienced childhood adversity were less likely than men with no childhood adversity to achieve generativity in midlife. Although achievement of generativity was associated with better later life health and adjustment to aging, it neither mediated nor moderated the negative relation between childhood poverty and later life health outcomes. However, for men who experienced an adversarial childhood, achievement of generativity mediated and moderated adjustment to aging. Discussion. Results suggest that psychosocial growth in adulthood can compensate for the long-term negative effects of an adversarial childhood on adjustment to aging, but not for later life health.","2014-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 20:03:14","","942-952","","6","69","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

However, researchers have not examined how a spouse's optimism  might impact an individual's health. We hypothesized that being optimistic (and  having an optimistic spouse) would both be associated with better health. METHODS:  Participants were 3940 adults (1970 couples) from the Health and Retirement Study, a  nationally representative panel study of American adults over the age of 50.  Participants were tracked for four years and outcomes included: physical  functioning, self-rated health, and number of chronic illnesses. We analyzed the  dyadic data using the actor-partner interdependence model. RESULTS: After  controlling for several psychological and demographic factors, a person's own  optimism and their spouse's optimism predicted better self-rated health and physical  functioning (bs = .08-.25, ps<.01). More optimistic people also reported better  physical functioning (b = -.11, p<.01) and fewer chronic illnesses (b=-.01, p<.05)  over time. Further, having an optimistic spouse uniquely predicted better physical  functioning (b = -.09, p<.01) and fewer chronic illnesses (b = -.01, p<.05) over  time. The strength of the relationship between optimism and health did not diminish  over time. CONCLUSIONS: Being optimistic and having an optimistic spouse were both  associated with better health. Examining partner effects is important because such  analyses reveal the unique role that spouses play in promoting health. These  findings may have important implications for future health interventions.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","447-453","","6","76","","J Psychosom Res","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research revealed that successful aging includes both objective and subjective dimensions. This longitudinal analysis examines how early life influences and midlife characteristics predict stability and change in successful aging over a 4-year period. Method. Data from 3,379 people living in New Jersey who completed baseline telephone interviews between 2006 and 2008 and follow-up mail surveys in 2011 were analyzed. Latent profile analysis identified people who aged successfully according to both objective and subjective criteria, neither criteria, and one, but not the other criteria. Multinomial logistic regressions analyses focused on the 2,614 people who were successful according to both objective and subjective criteria at baseline. Results. At follow-up, 18.1% people successful at baseline had transitioned out of that status. Characteristics identifiable early in life (gender, race, education, never marrying, incarceration) as well as midlife status (currently married, working), health behaviors (smoking, drinking, body mass index, exercise), and social support distinguished people who continued to age successfully 4 years later from those who did not. Discussion. Findings suggest that successful aging is a fluid construct and that although some characteristics identifiable early in life predict successful aging, others are dampened by midlife statuses.","2015-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:15:53","","850-859","","6","70","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

We  investigated determinants, MRI-correlates, and prognosis of MCI within the  population-based Rotterdam Study. Firstly, we studied age, APOE-ε4 carriership,  waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, total and HDL-cholesterol  levels, smoking, and stroke as potential determinants of MCI. Determinants were  assessed cross-sectionally at baseline (2002-2005) and up to 7 years prior to  baseline (1997-2001). Secondly, we compared volumetric, microstructural, and focal  MRI-correlates in persons with and without MCI. Thirdly, we followed participants  for incident dementia and mortality until 2012. Out of 4,198 participants, 417 had  MCI, of whom 163 amnestic and 254 non-amnestic MCI. At baseline, older age, APOE-ε4  carriership, lower total cholesterol levels, and stroke were associated with MCI.  Additionally, lower HDL-cholesterol levels and smoking were related to MCI when  assessed 7 years prior to baseline. Persons with MCI, particularly those with  non-amnestic MCI, had larger white matter lesion volumes, worse microstructural  integrity of normal-appearing white matter, and a higher prevalence of lacunes,  compared to cognitively healthy participants. MCI was associated with an increased  risk of dementia (hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.97;5.33),  Alzheimer's disease (HR 4.03, 95% CI 2.92;5.56), and mortality (HR 1.54, 95% CI  1.28;1.85). In conclusion, we found that several vascular risk factors and  MRI-correlates of cerebrovascular disease were related to MCI in the general  population.

In  the current study, we sought to extend previous findings by examining whether  purpose in life promotes longevity across the adult years, using data from the  longitudinal Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) sample. Proportional-hazards  models demonstrated that purposeful individuals lived longer than their counterparts  did during the 14 years after the baseline assessment, even when controlling for  other markers of psychological and affective well-being. Moreover, these longevity  benefits did not appear to be conditional on the participants' age, how long they  lived during the follow-up period, or whether they had retired from the workforce.  In other words, having a purpose in life appears to widely buffer against mortality  risk across the adult years.","2014-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1482-1486","","7","25","","Psychol Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author(s) 2014.","","","","","","PMID: 24815612  PMCID: PMC4224996","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; United States; Prognosis; aging; *Aging; *Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models; Young Adult; *Longevity; *Motivation; *Value of Life; adult development; open data; open materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Community-based cohort study. SETTING: Eight  contiguous states in the Yoruba-speaking region of Nigeria. PARTICIPANTS: A  multistage clustered sampling of households was used to select a representative  sample of individuals (N = 2,149) aged 65 and older at baseline. Nine hundred thirty  were successfully followed for an average of 64 months between August 2003 and  December 2009. MEASUREMENTS: Lifestyle and behavioral factors were assessed at  baseline. Successful aging, defined using each of three models (absence of chronic  health conditions, functional independence, and satisfaction with life), was  assessed at follow-up. RESULTS: Between 16% and 75% of respondents could be  classified as successful agers using one of the three models while 7.5% could be so  classified using a combination of all the models. Correlations between the three  models were small, ranging from 0.08 to 0.15. Different features predicted their  outcomes, suggesting that they represent relatively independent trajectories of  aging. Whichever model was used, more men than women tended to be classified as  aging successfully. Men who aged successfully, using a combination of all the three  models, were more likely never to have smoked (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.7, 95%  confidence interval (CI) = 1.55-14.46) and to report, at baseline, having contacts  with friends (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.0-18.76) or participating in community  activities (aOR = 16.0, 95% CI = 1.23-204.40). In women, there was a nonlinear trend  for younger age at baseline to predict this outcome.

The current study aimed to examine  personality as defined by the Five-Factor model of personality as an antecedent of  attitudes, while taking into account demographic and health factors known to be  relevant to such attitudes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants aged 60 years or older  (N = 421) were part of a longitudinal study of health and well-being in Australia,  and completed a postal survey comprising measures of personality, the Attitudes to  Ageing Questionnaire, the SF-12 health survey, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale.  RESULTS: Higher levels of neuroticism were associated with less positive attitudes  toward old age as a time of psychological growth, and higher extraversion and  agreeableness were significant predictors of less negative attitudes toward  psychosocial loss. Baseline measures of self-reported mental and physical health, as  well as change in those scores, also made significant contributions to attitudes  toward aging. IMPLICATIONS: Personality was a significant antecedent of attitudes  towards aging, as were mental and physical health. The data highlight the role of  potentially modifiable factors, such as mental and physical health. If these factors  act as resources that shape an individual's attitudes during the aging process, then  one potential foundation for holding positive attitudes to aging is to maintain  physical and mental health. This requires interventions and policies that are  effective in encouraging health-promoting behaviors.","2016-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","256-265","","2","56","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2014.

One likely reason for the lack of  reference to brain-oriented work is the persisting gap between smaller sample size  lab-experimental and larger sample size multivariate-correlational approaches to  psychological research. As a strategy for addressing this gap and bringing a  distinct neuroscientific component to the National Institute on Aging's  conscientiousness and health initiative, I suggest that the metric bridging approach  highlighted by Friedman and colleagues could be used to connect existing large-scale  data sets containing both neurophysiological variables and measures of individual  difference constructs to other data sets containing richer arrays of  nonphysiological variables-including data from longitudinal or twin studies focusing  on personality and health-related outcomes (e.g., Terman Life Cycle study and Hawaii  longitudinal studies, as described in the article by Kern et al., 2014).","2014-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1465-1469","","5","50","","Dev Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).","","","","","","PMID: 24773108  PMCID: PMC4149252","","","","Humans; Female; Male; *Health; *Research Design; Aging/*psychology; *Personality; *Longitudinal Studies; *Models, Psychological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to  investigate the association of vertigo and dizziness with self-perceived  participation and autonomy in older non-institutionalised individuals, adjusted for  the presence of other health conditions. Specifically, we wanted to investigate the  different effects of vertigo and dizziness on specific components of participation,  i.e. restrictions in indoor and outdoor autonomy, family role, social life and  relationships, and work and education. METHODS: Data originate from the second wave  of the German KORA-Age cohort study collected in 2012. Participation and autonomy  was investigated with the Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire. We  used robust regression to analyse the association of vertigo and dizziness with  self-perceived participation and autonomy adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total  of 822 participants (49.6% female) had a mean age of 78.1 years (SD 6.39).  Participation and autonomy were significantly lower in participants with vertigo and  dizziness across all domains. Adjusted for age, sex, and chronic conditions, vertigo  and dizziness were significantly associated with participation restrictions in all  domains except social life and relationships. CONCLUSION: The results of our study  indicate that vertigo and dizziness contribute to restrictions in participation and  autonomy in individuals of older age. Recognising vertigo and dizziness as  independent contributors to loss of autonomy and decreased chances for independent  living may create new options for patient care and population health, such as the  designing of complex interventions to maintain participation and autonomy.","2014-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:52:17","","2301-2308","","8","23","","Qual Life Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 24719016","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Quality of Life/*psychology; Self Concept; Social Participation/*psychology; *Self Concept; Dizziness/*psychology; Vertigo/*psychology; Social Participation -- psychology; Quality of Life -- psychology; Dizziness -- psychology; Vertigo -- psychology; Questionnaires; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Dizziness -- Psychosocial Factors; Social Participation -- Psychosocial Factors; Vertigo -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that social engagement can maintain cognition;  however, none has examined the effects of grandparenting, an important role among  postmenopausal women. This study aims to examine the role of grandparenting in  cognition among postmenopausal women. METHODS: Participants were 186 Australian  women from the longitudinal prospective Women's Healthy Aging Project. Cognition was  assessed using the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), California Verbal Learning  Test, and Tower of London. RESULTS: Amount of time spent minding grandchildren  predicted differences in SDMT performance (P < 0.01). The highest cognitive scores  for most tests were seen in participants who minded grandchildren for 1 day/week.  Minding grandchildren for 1 day/week was also a significant positive predictor of  California Verbal Learning Test immediate recall performance (P < 0.05). However,  minding grandchildren for 5 days or more per week predicted lower SDMT performance  (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the highest cognitive performance is  demonstrated by postmenopausal women who spend 1 day/week minding grandchildren;  however, minding grandchildren for 5 days or more per week predicts lower working  memory performance and processing speed. These results indicate that highly frequent  grandparenting predicts lower cognitive performance.","2014-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:02:34","","1069-1074","","10","21","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24714623","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Women's Health; Prospective Studies; Australia; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Cognition/*physiology; Aging/psychology; Memory, Short-Term; Intelligence Tests; Parenting/*psychology; Postmenopause/*psychology; *Women's Health; Family/*psychology; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Parenting; Memory, Short Term; Family -- Psychosocial Factors; Postmenopause -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A proposed model with age, sex, energy intake and chronic  diseases as predictors associated with body composition components, while the latter  associated with physical performance and with PA acting both as a predictor and as  an outcome of physical performance. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 847, community  dwellers, non-diabetic older men and women from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on  Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge Study). MEASUREMENTS: Physical performance  tests were reduced to two indices: strength and mobility. Muscle mass index (MMI;  kg/height(2)) and % body fat were derived from DXA and bioimpedance analysis (BIA).  PA was assessed by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and energy  intakes were calculated from 24-hour food recalls. Data from the NuAge dataset  served to test the relationships. The proposed model was evaluated using indices of  fit. RESULTS: Significant associations were found for MMI and % body fat with  mobility (β -0.11 and -0.02, respectively), and for MMI with strength (β=0.60). PA  was associated with MMI (β=0.02) and negatively with % body fat (β=-0.16), while  mobility associated with PA (β=0.65). Our hypothesized model, with some paths added,  fit the data: chi-square=4.64, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.  CONCLUSIONS: PA has desirable associations with body composition in older adults and  mobility is associated with PA. These results stress the importance of taking into  account the prior level of mobility when recommending PA for this age group. This  model could explain in part the complex interrelationships that occur with aging and  the potential factors that could be targeted to assist older individuals in  maintaining functional capacity.","2014-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:46:22","","37-43","","","55","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is known that in this condition the connectivity patterns are altered in the resting  state and during cognitive tasks, where an extra effort seems to be necessary to  overcome cognitive decline. We aimed to determine the functional connectivity  pattern required to deal with an internally directed cognitive state (IDICS) in  healthy aging and MCI. This task differs from the most commonly employed ones in  neurophysiology, since inhibition from external stimuli is needed, allowing the  study of this control mechanism. To this end, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals  were acquired from 32 healthy individuals and 38 MCI patients, both in resting state  and while performing a subtraction task of two levels of difficulty. Functional  connectivity was assessed with phase locking value (PLV) in five frequency bands.  Compared to controls, MCIs showed higher PLV values in delta, theta, and gamma bands  and an opposite pattern in alpha, beta, and gamma bands in resting state. These  changes were associated with poorer neuropsychological performance. During the task,  this group exhibited a hypersynchronization in delta, theta, beta, and gamma bands,  which was also related to a lower cognitive performance, suggesting an abnormal  functioning in this group. Contrary to controls, MCIs presented a lack of  synchronization in the alpha band which may denote an inhibition deficit.  Additionally, the magnitude of connectivity changes rose with the task difficulty in  controls but not in MCIs, in line with the compensation-related utilization of  neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH) model.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9643","","3","36","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24658709  PMCID: PMC4082567","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Cognition/*physiology; Aging/*psychology; Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/*physiopathology/psychology; Hippocampus/pathology/*physiopathology; Magnetoencephalography/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study with diet measured  in 1990-4, and successful ageing in 2003-7. Ordered logistic regression with outcome  determined as dead/usual ageing/successful ageing was used to examine associations  with quintile groups of dietary factor scores. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women (n=6308),  without history of major illness at baseline, and aged >70 years at follow-up, or  who had died before follow-up but would have been aged >70 at the commencement of  follow-up, from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. MEASUREMENTS: Frequencies  of intake of 121 foods at baseline were collected in a food frequency questionnaire.  Anthropometry and other health and lifestyle data were collected. At follow-up,  questionnaire data relating to mental health, physical function and medical history  were used to define successful ageing. RESULTS: Four dietary factors were  identified, characterized by higher loadings for (1) vegetables; (2) fruit, (3)  feta, legumes, salad, olive oil, and inverse loadings for tea, margarine, cake,  sweet biscuits and puddings; (4) meat, white bread, savoury pastry dishes and fried  foods. In models excluding body size, the second factor 'Fruit' was positively  associated with successful ageing (OR in top 20% vs lowest 20% of score 1.31, 95%CI  (1.05-1.63), p trend across quintile groups 0.001); while the fourth factor  'Meat/fatty foods' was inversely associated (OR in top 20% vs lowest 20% of score  0.69, 95%CI (0.55-0.86), p trend across quintile groups 0.001). Factors 1 and 3 did  not show significant associations with successful ageing. The association for  'Fruit' was little altered after adjustment for body size, while for 'Meat/fatty  foods' the association was somewhat attenuated. CONCLUSION: A dietary pattern  including plenty of fruit while limiting meat and fried foods may improve the  likelihood of ageing successfully.","2014-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:43:36","","221-227","","3","18","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 24626747","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Health Behavior; Feeding Behavior; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Fruit; Meat; Vegetables; Cooking; Aging/*physiology; *Feeding Behavior; Diet/*statistics & numerical data; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Victoria/epidemiology; Diet -- statistics & numerical data; Victoria -- epidemiology; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Factor Analysis; Food Habits -- Evaluation; Geographic Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was relevant to establish if  healthily aging, non-obese individuals develop changes in leptin, the soluble leptin  receptor (OB-Re), free leptin index (FLI), in methylation of the leptin receptor  gene (LEPR) promoter, and in the expression of long (OB-Rb) and short (OB-Ra) leptin  receptor isoforms. METHODS: We analyzed these parameters in 38 young (aged  26.8 ± 3.6 years), 37 elderly (aged 64.7 ± 3.1 years) and 39 long-lived (aged  94.2 ± 3.7 years) healthy, non-obese Polish Caucasians. RESULTS: In elderly men, the  median concentration of leptin and the median FLI were significantly higher than in  young men (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively), which was probably partly due to  a higher mean body mass index of the elderly study participants. In peripheral blood  mononuclear cells, the expression of functionally active OB-Rb did not depend on age  or sex, whereas the expression of OB-Ra was lower in the elderly and long-lived  groups than in the young group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.002, respectively), mostly due  to changes observed in women. Most likely, this age-related decrease was not due to  hypermethylation of the LEPR promoter, as methylation of the +20 to +281 fragment of  the CpG island did not change with age. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy, non-obese  individuals, only some elements of the leptin axis slightly change with age. On that  basis, we suggest that proper function of this axis might be required for this  particular phenotype of aging. The present results should, however, be replicated in  prospective studies and in other ethnic groups.","2015-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","365-371","","3","15","","Geriatr Gerontol Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014 Japan Geriatrics Society.","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 24612398","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; healthy aging; Young Adult; DNA Methylation; Healthy Volunteers; Biomarkers/blood; Poland/epidemiology; *Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Aging/blood/*genetics; Dyslipidemias/blood/epidemiology/*genetics; free leptin index; leptin; leptin receptor isoforms; Leptin/biosynthesis/*genetics; Receptors, Leptin/biosynthesis/*genetics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The neurobiological correlate of this variation is not well described. Functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated reduced task-induced deactivation (TID) of the brain's default mode network (DMN) in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases involving cognitive symptoms, in conditions with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, and even in advanced but healthy aging. Here, we investigated brain activation and deactivation during a visual-motor task in 185 clinically healthy males from a Danish birth cohort, whose cognitive function was assessed in youth and midlife. Using each individual as his own control, we defined a group with a large degree of cognitive decline, and a control group. When correcting for effects of total cerebral blood flow and hemoglobin level, we found reduced TID in the posterior region of the DMN in the cognitive decline group compared to the control group. Furthermore, increased visual activation response was found in the cognitive decline group, indicating that the TID reduction was not exclusively due to overall impaired vascular reactivity. These results suggest a neurobiological basis for subclinical cognitive decline in late midlife, which includes TID alterations similar to the pattern seen in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. Hence, TID reduction might be suggested as an early marker for subtle cognitive decline in aging.","2014-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:52:26","","4488-4498","","9","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 24578157  PMCID: PMC6869675","","","","Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Male; Cerebrovascular Circulation -- physiology; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance -- physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping; Brain -- physiology; Cognition Disorders -- etiology; aging; Cognition/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Denmark; cognitive decline; fMRI; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology; Cognition Disorders/etiology/physiopathology; Hemoglobins/metabolism; Neural Pathways/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; task-induced deactivation; Visual Perception/physiology; Cognition Disorders -- physiopathology; Brain -- blood supply; Visual Perception -- physiology; Hemoglobins; Hemoglobins -- metabolism; Neural Pathways -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The exact underlying mechanisms are  largely unknown, but enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and preservation of  mitochondrial function have been suggested to explain healthy ageing. We  investigated whether individuals belonging to long-lived families have altered  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, as a biomarker of mitochondrial biogenesis and  measured expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. mtDNA and nuclear  DNA (nDNA) levels were measured in blood samples from 2,734 participants from the  Leiden Longevity Study: 704 nonagenarian siblings, 1,388 of their middle-aged  offspring and 642 controls. We confirmed a negative correlation of mtDNA content in  blood with age and a higher content in females. The middle-aged offspring had, on  average, lower levels of mtDNA than controls and the nonagenarian siblings had an  even lower mtDNA content (mtDNA/nDNA ratio = 0.744 ± 0.065, 0.767 ± 0.058 and  0.698 ± 0.074, respectively; p controls-offspring = 3.4 × 10(-12), p  controls-nonagenarians = 6.5 × 10(-6)), which was independent of the confounding  effects of age and gender. Subsequently, we examined in a subset of the study the  expression in blood of two genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, YY1 and  PGC-1α. We found a positive association of YY1 expression and mtDNA content in  controls. The observed absence of such an association in the offspring suggests an  altered regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in the members of long-lived  families. In conclusion, in this study, we show that mtDNA content decreases with  age and that low mtDNA content is associated with familial longevity. Our data  suggest that preservation of mitochondrial function rather than enhancing  mitochondrial biogenesis is a characteristic of long-lived families.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9629","","3","36","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24554339  PMCID: PMC4082602","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Aging/*genetics; Longevity/*genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics; Mitochondria/*genetics/metabolism; Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha; Siblings; Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics; YY1 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vascular risk factors may  increase the risk of functional impairment due to clinical and subclinical vascular  disease. OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between vascular risk factors and  impaired ability to perform daily living activities, independent of established  cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of the Clarity Cohort,  which is a cross-sectional study of 9,816 community-dwelling Irish adults. Of the  total cohort, 3,499 completed standardized self-reported health questionnaires,  which included questions on activities of daily living. Functional impairment was  defined as self-reported impairment in self-care, mobility or household tasks. Using  logistic regression analyses, we determined the association between vascular risk  factors and functional impairment, independent of demographics, prior coronary  artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.  RESULTS: Functional impairment was reported in 40.4% (n = 1,413) of the cohort  overall and in 23% of those with established cardiovascular disease. The mean age  was 66.2 ± 10.3 years, 52% of the cohort were aged over 65 and 45.6% were male. Some  difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living was reported by 35.4% (n =  1,240) while 29.4% (n = 1,029) reported some difficulty with basic activities of  daily living. On multivariable analysis, older age [OR 1.03 (1.02, 1.04) per year],  current smoking [OR 1.43 (1.08, 1.89)], atrial fibrillation [OR 1.68 (1.07, 2.65)],  former alcohol use [OR 1.87 (1.36, 2.57)] and prior stroke [OR 1.91 (1.24, 2.93)]  were associated with an increased risk of functional impairment. Older age leaving  education [OR 0.96 (0.94, 0.99)], non-use of alcohol [OR 0.76 (0.61, 0.93)] and  increased high-density lipoprotein levels [OR 0.70 (0.56, 0.88)] were associated  with reduced risk of functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of established  cardiovascular disease, some vascular risk factors are associated with functional  impairment. Modification of these risk factors is expected to have a large impact on  preservation of functional independence through prevention of overt and covert  vascular disease.","2014","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","212-221","","3","60","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 24457648","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Cohort Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Logistic Models; Multivariate Analysis; Aging/*physiology; Ireland/epidemiology; Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects; Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & control; Smoking/adverse effects; Vascular Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: British Regional Heart Study.  PARTICIPANTS: Men aged 60-79 years (n = 4,252). MEASUREMENTS: Baseline waist  circumference (WC) and midarm muscle circumference (MAMC) measurements were used to  classify participants into four groups: sarcopenic, obese, sarcopenic obese, or  optimal WC and MAMC. The cohort was followed for a mean of 11.3 years for CVD and  all-cause mortality. Cox regression analyses assessed associations between  sarcopenic obesity groups and all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, and  coronary heart disease (CHD) events. RESULTS: There were 1,314 deaths, 518 CVD  deaths, 852 CVD events, and 458 CHD events during follow-up. All-cause mortality  risk was significantly greater in sarcopenic (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.22-1.63) and  obese (HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.03-1.42) men than in the optimal reference group, with  the highest risk in sarcopenic obese (HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.35-2.18), after  adjustment for lifestyle characteristics. Risk of CVD mortality was significantly  greater in sarcopenic and obese but not sarcopenic obese men. No association was  seen between sarcopenic obesity groups and CHD or CVD events. CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia  and central adiposity were associated with greater cardiovascular mortality and  all-cause mortality. Sarcopenic obese men had the highest risk of all-cause  mortality but not CVD mortality. Efforts to promote healthy aging should focus on  preventing obesity and maintaining muscle mass.","2014-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:02:21","","253-260","","2","62","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","© 2014, Copyright the Authors.

Recent studies have suggested that exposure  to prolonged psychological stress may alter an individual's physiological responses,  and contribute to morbidity and mortality. This paper presents an overview of the  study protocol we are using to examine the impact of life stressors on lifestyle  factors, health-related quality of life and novel and established biomarkers of  stress in midlife and older Australian women.The primary aim of this study is to  explore the links between chronic psychological stress on both subjective and  objective health markers in midlife and older Australian women. The study examines  the extent to which exposure frightening, upsetting or stressful events such as  natural disasters, illness or death of a relative, miscarriage and relationship  conflict is correlated with a variety of objective and subjective health markers.  METHODS/DESIGN: This study is embedded within the longitudinal Healthy Aging of  Women's study which has collected data from midlife and older Australian women at 5  yearly intervals since 2001, and uses the Allostastic model of women's health by  Groër and colleagues in 2010. The current study expands the focus of the HOW study  and will assess the impact of life stressors on quality of life and clinical  biomarkers in midlife and older Australian women to explain the impact of chronic  psychological stress in women. DISCUSSION: The proposed study hypothesizes that  women are at increased risk of exposure to multiple or repeated stressors, some  being unique to women, and the frequency and chronicity of stressors increases  women's risk of adverse health outcomes. This study aims to further our  understanding of the relationships between stressful life experiences, perceived  quality of life, stress biomarkers, chronic illness, and health status in women.","2014-01-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","9","","","14","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24400870  PMCID: PMC3890545","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Biomarkers; Australia; Perception; Life Change Events; *Health; Research Design; *Health Status; *Quality of Life; Chronic Disease; Anxiety/complications; *Women's Health; Mental Disorders/complications; Stress, Psychological/*complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These observations from functional neuroimaging studies show a  shift in brain activity from the posterior to the anterior regions with aging (PASA  model), as well as a decrease in cortical thickness, which is more pronounced in the  frontal lobe followed by the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes (retrogenesis  model). However, very little work has been done using diffusion MRI (dMRI) with  respect to examining the structural tissue alterations underlying these  neurofunctional changes in the gray matter. Thus, for the first time, we propose to  examine gray matter changes using diffusion MRI in the context of aging. In this  work, we propose a novel dMRI based measure of gray matter ""heterogeneity"" that  elucidates these functional and structural models (PASA and retrogenesis) of aging  from the viewpoint of diffusion MRI. In a cohort of 85 subjects (all males, ages  15-55 years), we show very high correlation between age and ""heterogeneity"" (a  measure of structural layout of tissue in a region-of-interest) in specific brain  regions. We examine gray matter alterations by grouping brain regions into  anatomical lobes as well as functional zones. Our findings from dMRI data connects  the functional and structural domains and confirms the ""retrogenesis"" hypothesis of  gray matter alterations while lending support to the neurofunctional PASA model of  aging in addition to showing the preservation of paralimbic areas during healthy  aging.","2014-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:13","","3841-3856","","8","35","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","PMID: 24382651  PMCID: PMC4101075","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- pathology; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Brain -- pathology; aging; Young Adult; Aging/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; Models, Neurological; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Gray Matter/*pathology; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; diffusion MRI; free-water; gray matter; Gray Matter -- pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Protein intake below the current RDA [0.8 g/(kg · d)] is also common in older  adults; however, the link between the 2 has received little attention. Our objective  was to assess the relation between protein intake and incident 1-y weight loss ≥5%  in community-dwelling older adults. We conducted a nested, prospective, case-control  study in 1793 community-living elderly participants of the Quebec Longitudinal Study  of Nutrition as a Determinant of Successful Aging (NuAge). We studied 211 incident  cases of 1-y weight loss (≥5%) and 211 weight-stable controls (±2%) matched by sex  and age category (70 ± 2, 75 ± 2, and 80 ± 2 y). Diet was measured by 3  nonconsecutive 24-h recalls. ORs (95% CIs) for the association between protein  intake and weight loss were computed by using conditional logistic regression. After  adjustment for body mass index, energy intake, appetite, smoking status, physical  activity level, physical function, chronic diseases and medications, depressive  symptoms, and serum albumin and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, the ORs of weight  loss in participants with low protein intakes [<0.8 g/(kg · d)] were 2.56 (95% CI:  1.01, 6.50) compared with participants with very high protein intakes [≥1.2 g/(kg ·  d)]. Corresponding numbers were 2.15 (95% CI: 1.02, 4.56) in participants with  moderate protein intakes [0.8-<1.0 g/(kg · d)] and 1.33 (95% CI: 0.77, 2.28) in  participants with high protein intakes [1.0-1.2 g/(kg · d)].

Prospective studies indicate that life satisfaction is  associated with good health behaviors, enhanced health, and longer life, but little  information about the association between life satisfaction and health care use is  available. We tested whether higher life satisfaction was prospectively associated  with fewer doctor visits. We also examined potential interactions between life  satisfaction and health behaviors. METHODS: Participants were 6379 adults from the  Health and Retirement Study, a prospective and nationally representative panel study  of American adults older than 50 years. Participants were tracked for 4 years. We  analyzed the data using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log  link. RESULTS: Higher life satisfaction was associated with fewer doctor visits. On  a 6-point life satisfaction scale, each unit increase in life satisfaction was  associated with an 11% decrease in doctor visits--after adjusting for  sociodemographic factors (relative risk = 0.89, 95% confidence interval =  0.86-0.93). The most satisfied respondents (n = 1121; 17.58%) made 44% fewer doctor  visits than did the least satisfied (n = 182; 2.85%). The association between higher  life satisfaction and reduced doctor visits remained even after adjusting for  baseline health and a wide range of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and  health-related covariates (relative risk = 0.96, 95% confidence interval =  0.93-0.99).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe and compare the time and monetary  costs associated with recruiting and interviewing a diverse sample of older adults  living in south Florida. METHODS: Men and women aged 60 years and older from four  ethnic groups-African American, Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic American, and European  American-were recruited to participate in a longitudinal study of healthy aging.  Costs for study activities (including recruitment, scheduling sessions,  interviewing, file scoring, log updating, blood specimen analysis and storage, data  analysis, and monetary compensation to participants) were determined after 100 weeks  of data collection. RESULTS: Altogether, 483 participants completed the study in the  first 100 weeks. The total cost for each participant ranged from $265 to $576. Each  successful enrollment required an average of 1.83 hours for recruitment and  scheduling of the interviews. The time to interview African American and  Afro-Caribbeans was greater than the time needed to interview Hispanic American and  European American participants. DISCUSSION: To develop more accurate budgets for  recruitment of minority individuals into research studies and to use the limited  resources in an effective way, careful planning and ongoing monitoring of costs are  essential.","2014-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","63-67","","1","63","","Nurs Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24335914","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; African Americans/statistics & numerical data; European Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data; Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical data; *Patient Selection; African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data; Biomedical Research/*economics; Data Collection/*economics; Florida; Longitudinal Studies/*economics; Minority Groups/*statistics & numerical data; Research Design/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this aim we comprehensively characterised a cohort of 1,160  Italian subjects of 90 years and over (90+, mean age 93 years; age range  90-106 years) followed for 6 years survival, belonging to 552 sib-ships (familiar  longevity) recruited (2005-2008) within the EU-funded GEHA project in three Italian  geographic areas (Northern, Central and Southern Italy) different for urban/rural  and socio-economical characteristics. On the whole, the following factors emerged as  significant predictors of survival after 90 years of age: absence of cognitive  impairment and physical disability, high hand grip strength scores and body mass  index (BMI) values, ""excellent/good"" self-reported health, high haemoglobin and  total cholesterol levels and low creatinine levels. These parameters, excluding BMI  values, were also significantly associated within sib-ships, suggesting a strong  familial/genetic component. Geographical micro-heterogeneity of survival predictors  emerged, such as functional and physical status being more important in Southern  than in Central and Northern Italy. In conclusion, we identified modifiable survival  predictors related to specific domains, whose role and importance vary according to  the geographic area considered and which can help in interpreting the genetic  results obtained by the GEHA project, whose major aim is the comprehensive  evaluation of phenotypic and genetic data.","2014-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","949-966","","2","36","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24323371  PMCID: PMC4039258","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Europe/epidemiology; Retrospective Studies; Phenotype; *Health Status; *Activities of Daily Living; Aging/*genetics; Longevity/*genetics; Databases, Factual; Italy/epidemiology; Survival Rate/trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, we used themes from lay definitions of successful  aging to quantify the prevalence of primary and secondary control beliefs over time.  In doing so we hoped to shed new light upon the virtually uncharted area of older  men's primary and secondary control beliefs over time. Using successful aging  narratives spanning a 10-year timeframe from the Manitoba Follow-up Study cohort, we  mapped themes from older men's lay definitions of successful aging onto Rothbaum,  Weisz, and Snyder's (1982) constructs of primary and secondary control. We then  examined the prevalence of the constructs of control over 10 years and found that  some men emphasized primary control, some emphasized secondary control, and others  emphasized both, prospectively. Counter to what had previously been theorized, many  older men continued to emphasize primary control as important well into late life.  As expected, secondary control became more important with age. Furthermore, among  those men who endorsed both primary and secondary control, significantly more men  switched emphasis from primary to secondary control beliefs as they aged. This  finding supported Rothbaum et al.'s (1982) surmise that individuals could switch  from one type of control to another, presumably as life circumstances dictated.  Knowing which types of control beliefs older men emphasize as they age has  theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it sheds new light on the  under-researched area of control beliefs in older men. Practically, it is  informative for anyone interested in enhancing older men's perceptions of control in  very late life, particularly in the face of otherwise uncontrollable age-related  decline and imminent demise.","2013-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:27:31","","410-418","","4","27","","J Aging Stud","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 24300061","","","","Aged; Humans; Physical Fitness; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Prevalence; Time Factors; Internal-External Control; Perception; Aging/*psychology; Successful aging; *Attitude to Health; Narration; Control beliefs; Lay definitions; Men/*psychology; Narratives; Primary control; Secondary control; Trends in prevalence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have examined the effects of mid-life physical activity on healthy ageing, but not the effects of taking up activity later in life. We examined the association between physical activity and healthy ageing over 8 years of follow-up.Methods: Participants were 3454 initially disease-free men and women (aged 63.7 ± 8.9 years at baseline) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospective study of community dwelling older adults. Self-reported physical activity was assessed at baseline (2002-2003) and through follow-up. Healthy ageing, assessed at 8 years of follow-up (2010-2011), was defined as those participants who survived without developing major chronic disease, depressive symptoms, physical or cognitive impairment.Results: At follow-up, 19.3% of the sample was defined as healthy ageing. In comparison with inactive participants, moderate (OR, 2.67, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.64), or vigorous activity (3.53, 2.54 to 4.89) at least once a week was associated with healthy ageing, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, marital status and wealth. Becoming active (multivariate adjusted, 3.37, 1.67 to 6.78) or remaining active (7.68, 4.18 to 14.09) was associated with healthy ageing in comparison with remaining inactive over follow-up.Conclusions: Sustained physical activity in older age is associated with improved overall health.

Adequate protein and energy intakes and physical  activity (PA) may preserve MS during aging. However, the role of diet quality (DQ)  in MS maintenance is still unknown. This study aimed to determine the association  between DQ - alone or combined with PA - and changes in MS over 3 years in diabetic  participants aged 67 to 84 years at recruitment in a secondary analysis of the  longitudinal observational NuAge study. Changes in handgrip, knee extensor and elbow  flexor strengths were calculated as the difference between recruitment (T1) and  after 3 years (T4) in 156 diabetic older adults. Baseline DQ was calculated from 3  non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls collected at T1 using the validated Canadian  Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI). Change in PA was calculated from Physical Activity  Scale for the Elderly (PASE) as PASE T4-PASE T1. Four combinations of variables were  created: C-HEI<70 with PASE change either < or > median and C-HEI ≥ 70 with PASE  change either < or > median. The association between these four categories and MS  maintenance was evaluated using General Linear Modeling (GLM). Analyses were  stratified by sex and controlled for covariates. Baseline DQ alone was not  associated with MS maintenance. Baseline DQ combined with PASE change showed  associations with crude and baseline adjusted handgrip strength (p=0.031, p=0.018)  and crude and baseline adjusted elbow flexor change (p=0.028, p=0.017) in males  only; no significant results were found for knee extensor strength in either males  or females. While findings for females were inconclusive, results demonstrate that  better adherence to dietary guidelines combined with a more active lifestyle may  prevent MS decline among diabetic older males. Additional research is needed on a  larger sample since generalization of these results is limited by the small sample  size.","2014-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","40-46","","","49","","Exp Gerontol","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

For men, tenant  status (HR=1.46), former or current smoking (HR=1.17), disability (respective HR of  1.50, 1.78 and 2.81 for mild, moderate and severe level), dementia (HR=1.51), a  recent hospitalisation (HR=1.32), dyspnoea (HR=1.32), and cardiovascular symptoms  (HR=1.15) were associated with lower chance of becoming nonagenarian. Conversely,  regular physical activity (HR=0.74) was associated with higher chance of survival.  For women, the presence of a professional help (HR=1.19), living arrangements  (HR=1.29 and HR=1.33), disability (respective HR of 1.55, 1.95 and 2.70 for mild,  moderate and severe disability), dementia (HR=1.54), a recent hospitalisation  (HR=1.19), diabetes (HR=1.49), and dyspnoea (HR=1.20) were associated with lower  chance of becoming nonagenarian. Conversely, satisfaction of level income (HR=0.87),  comfortable housing (HR=0.81), length of living in the dwelling (HR=0.80 upper to 6  years), regular physical activity (HR=0.89) and a medium (HR=0.79) or good (HR=0.68)  subjective health, were associated with higher chance of becoming nonagenarian.  CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that survival up to 90 is a multifactorial  phenomenon with similarities and specificities by gender. Consequently, primary  prevention and global consideration of ageing (social, material, financial,  psychological) are necessary to promote not only longevity but also successful  ageing in order to face the future societal challenges due to demographic ageing.","2013","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","881-892","","10","17","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 24257572","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Attitude to Health; Prospective Studies; Personal Satisfaction; Sex Distribution; France/epidemiology; Smoking/epidemiology; Longevity/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Dementia/epidemiology; Residence Characteristics; Geriatric Assessment/*methods/*statistics & numerical data; Motor Activity; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low lung function is a  feature of several pulmonary disorders, such as uncontrolled asthma and chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease. The objective of this study is to investigate the  association of polymorphisms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  candidate genes with rates of lung function decline in a general population sample  of aging men. METHODS: We analyzed data from a cohort of 1,047 Caucasian men without  known lung disease, who had a mean of 25 years of lung function data, and on whom  DNA was available. The cohort was randomly divided into two groups, and we tested a  total of 940 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 44 asthma and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease candidate genes in the first group (testing cohort, n = 545) for  association with change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second over time. RESULTS:  One hundred nineteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed nominal  associations in the testing cohort were then genotyped and tested in the second  group (replication cohort, n = 502). Evidence for association from the testing and  replication cohorts were combined, and after adjustment for multiple testing, seven  variants of three genes (DPP10, NPSR1, and ADAM33) remained significantly associated  with change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings that genetic variants of genes involved in asthma and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease are associated with lung function decline in normal aging  participants suggest that similar genetic mechanisms may underlie lung function  decline in both disease and normal aging processes.","2014-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","907-913","","7","69","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2013.

Here we report diagnostic and cognitive findings at the first (18-month) follow-up of the cohort. The first aim was to compute rates of transition from HC to MCI, and MCI to AD. The second aim was to characterize the cognitive profiles of individuals who transitioned to a more severe disease stage compared with those who did not.Methods: Eighteen months after baseline, participants underwent comprehensive cognitive testing and diagnostic review, provided an 80 ml blood sample, and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. A subgroup also underwent amyloid PET and MRI neuroimaging.Results: The diagnostic status of 89.9% of the cohorts was determined (972 were reassessed, 28 had died, and 112 did not return for reassessment). The 18-month cohort comprised 692 HCs, 82 MCI cases, 197 AD patients, and one Parkinson's disease dementia case.

Using  the 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the 2004 Health and Retirement Study  to examine the proportion of Americans exhibiting five markers of health and the  variation in health-related quality of life across each of eight age groups, we find  that a significant proportion of older Americans is healthy within every age group  beginning at age 51, including among those aged 85+. For example, 48% of those aged  51-54 and 28% of those aged 85+ have excellent or very good self-reported health  status; similarly, 89% of those aged 51-54 and 56% of those aged 85+ report no  health-based limitations in work or housework. Also, health-related quality of life  ranges widely within every age group, yet there is only a comparatively small  variation in median quality of life across age groups, suggesting that older  Americans today may be experiencing substantially different age-health trajectories  than their predecessors. Patterns are similar for medical expenditures.

Some of the problems  confounding this research can be reduced by harmonising and pooling data across  studies. COSMIC (Cohort Studies of Memory in an International Consortium) aims to  harmonise data from international cohort studies of cognitive ageing, in order to  better understand the determinants of cognitive ageing and neurocognitive disorders.  METHODS/DESIGN: Longitudinal studies of cognitive ageing and dementia with at least  500 individuals aged 60 years or over are eligible and invited to be members of  COSMIC. There are currently 17 member studies, from regions that include Asia,  Australia, Europe, and North America. A Research Steering Committee has been  established, two meetings of study leaders held, and a website developed. The  initial attempts at harmonising key variables like neuropsychological test scores  are in progress. DISCUSSION: The challenges of international consortia like COSMIC  include efficient communication among members, extended use of resources, and data  harmonisation. Successful harmonisation will facilitate projects investigating rates  of cognitive decline, risk and protective factors for mild cognitive impairment, and  biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Extended implications of  COSMIC could include standardised ways of collecting and reporting data, and a rich  cognitive ageing database being made available to other researchers. COSMIC could  potentially transform our understanding of the epidemiology of cognitive ageing, and  have a world-wide impact on promoting successful ageing.","2013-11-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:13:27","","165","","","13","","BMC Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24195705  PMCID: PMC3827845","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Ethnic Groups; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Dementia -- Psychosocial Factors; *Internationality; *Social Identification; Aging/*ethnology/psychology; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*ethnology/psychology; Dementia/diagnosis/*ethnology/psychology; Ethnic Groups/*ethnology/psychology; Middle Age; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Ethnology; Cognition Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Dementia -- Diagnosis; Dementia -- Ethnology; Ethnic Groups -- Psychosocial Factors; International Relations; Social Identity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/glt167","","BACKGROUND: Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) exhibit strong predictive power for the presence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.  However, IADLs are often less effective in younger cohorts or in healthy  community-dwelling samples, presenting with large ceiling effects. This study aimed  to construct an IADL scale with an extended range. An effort was made to incorporate  leisure activity tasks that were more stimulating, and potentially more challenging,  into a set of traditional IADLs. METHODS: Beginning with a set of IADL and leisure  activity items, nonparametric item response theory methodology was used to construct  a scale with appropriate dimensionality, monotonicity, item discrimination power,  and scalability within a large cohort of young-old (aged 65-75). Dimensionality was  further scrutinized by principal component analysis of the residuals. The predictive  validity of the resulting scale for poor cognitive performance was evaluated using  logistic regression. RESULTS: A reliable (ρ = .73) unidimensional construct was  established, meeting the Mokken item response theory criteria of medium scalability.  Excluding demented participants, the adjusted model proved sensitive to relatively  subtle cognitive deficits; each additional task endorsed (nine-item scale)  significantly decreased the odds of being in the bottom quarter of composite domains  relating to processing speed (odds ratio = 0.73 [confidence interval: 0.56-0.97], p  < .05) and visuospatial ability (odds ratio = 0.70 [confidence interval: 0.73-0.87],  p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: A reliable extended-IADL scale was constructed meeting item  response theory assumptions relating to unidimensionality, monotonicity, and  invariant item ordering. The range of measurement extends well beyond traditional  IADL scales. Finally, the scale appears to be sensitive to cognitive differences  within the normal spectrum.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","766-772","","6","69","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2013.

To date, little is known about the mechanisms underlying these  effects. This study therefore examined whether negative SPA impair the use of  self-regulation strategies that include selection, optimization, and compensation  (SOC) in case of a serious health event and thus turn into self-fulfilling  prophecies for health and life satisfaction. Based on a longitudinal nationwide  study with 2 measurement points over a 6-month period in 309 older people (65+ years  of age) with multiple illnesses, 2 major findings emerged: First, the occurrence of  a serious health event predicted increased use of SOC strategies, which in turn  predicted higher self-rated health and life satisfaction. Second, this effect was  moderated by negative SPA, that is, in case of a serious health event, the  perception that aging is associated with physical losses led to lower use of SOC  strategies promoting a healthy lifestyle (B = -0.43, SE = 0.15, p < .01). These  findings contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SPA on  health by showing that negative SPA as associated with physical losses might impair  health-related strategies that are important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  Future intervention studies could attempt to challenge negative SPA to support  effective strategy use in older adults with serious illnesses.","2013-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:09:06","","1088-1097","","4","28","","Psychol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 24128074","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Personal Satisfaction; Life Change Events; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Self Report; Aging/physiology/*psychology; *Health Status; *Personal Satisfaction; Self Concept; *Self Concept; *Social Control, Informal; Middle Age; Regression; Self Regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify effective intervention and prevention strategies, greater understanding of the risk factors for and cumulative effects of chronic disease processes and their effects on function and quality of life is needed.The Busselton Healthy Ageing Study aims to enhance understanding of ageing by relating the clustering and interactions of common chronic conditions in adults to function. Longitudinal (3-5 yearly) follow-up is planned.Methods/design: Phase I (recruitment) is a cross-sectional community-based prospective cohort study involving up to 4,000 'Baby Boomers' (born from 1946 to 1964) living in the Busselton Shire, Western Australia. The study protocol involves a detailed, self-administered health and risk factor questionnaire and a range of physical assessments including body composition and bone density measurements, cardiovascular profiling (blood pressure, ECG and brachial pulse wave velocity), retinal photography, tonometry, auto-refraction, spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness, skin allergy prick tests, sleep apnoea screening, tympanometry and audiometry, grip strength, mobility, balance and leg extensor strength. Cognitive function and reserve, semantic memory, and pre-morbid intelligence are assessed. Participants provide a fasting blood sample for assessment of lipids, blood glucose, C-reactive protein and renal and liver function, and RNA, DNA and serum are stored. Clinically relevant results are provided to all participants. The prevalence of risk factors, symptoms and diagnosed illness will be calculated and the burden of illness will be estimated based on the observed relationships and clustering of symptoms and illness within individuals. Risk factors for combinations of illness will be compared with those for single illnesses and the relation of combinations of illness and symptoms to cognitive and physical function will be estimated.Discussion: This study will enable a thorough characterization of multiple disease processes and their risk factors within a community-based sample of individuals to determine their singular, interactive and cumulative effects on ageing.

We assessed inflammatory markers twice over a 5-year exposure period to examine the association between chronic inflammation and future aging phenotypes in a large population of men and women.Methods: We obtained data for 3044 middle-aged adults (28.2% women) who were participating in the Whitehall II study and had no history of stroke, myocardial infarction or cancer at our study's baseline (1997-1999). Interleukin-6 was measured at baseline and 5 years earlier. Cause-specific mortality, chronic disease and functioning were ascertained from hospital data, register linkage and clinical examinations. We used these data to create 4 aging phenotypes at the 10-year follow-up (2007-2009): successful aging (free of major chronic disease and with optimal physical, mental and cognitive functioning), incident fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease, death from noncardiovascular causes and normal aging (all other participants).Results: Of the 3044 participants, 721 (23.7%) met the criteria for successful aging at the 10-year follow-up, 321 (10.6%) had cardiovascular disease events, 147 (4.8%) died from noncardiovascular causes, and the remaining 1855 (60.9%) were included in the normal aging phenotype. After adjustment for potential confounders, having a high interleukin-6 level (> 2.0 ng/L) twice over the 5-year exposure period nearly halved the odds of successful aging at the 10-year follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.74) and increased the risk of future cardiovascular events (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.15-2.33) and noncardiovascular death (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58-3.80).Interpretation: Chronic inflammation, as ascertained by repeat measurements, was associated with a range of unhealthy aging phenotypes and a decreased likelihood of successful aging. Our results suggest that assessing long-term chronic inflammation by repeat measurement of interleukin-6 has the potential to guide clinical practice.","2013-11-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 20:03:41","","E763-770","","16","185","","CMAJ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 24043651  PMCID: PMC3826354","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Odds Ratio; Human; Phenotype; Chronic Disease; Aging/*immunology; Inflammation; Cardiovascular Diseases/*immunology; Interleukin-6/*immunology; Middle Age; Aging -- Immunology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Immunology; Interleukins -- Immunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether equal  adherence to ""prudent"" and ""Western"" dietary patterns, identified by principal  components analysis, was associated with global cognitive function [Modified  Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)] in independently living older adults with  different SEPs (aged 68-84 y; n = 1099). The interaction of dietary pattern  adherence with household income, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and  a composite indicator of SEP combining all 3 was examined in multiple-adjusted mixed  models over 3 y of follow-up in participants of the NuAge study (Quebec Longitudinal  Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging). Adherence to the prudent pattern  (vegetables, fruits, fish, poultry, and lower-fat dairy products) was related to  higher 3MS scores at recruitment only in the upper categories of income [parameter  estimate (B): 0.56; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.01], education (B: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.080, 0.80),  or composite SEP (B: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.045, 0.70). High prudent pattern adherence was  associated with less cognitive decline only in those with low composite SEP (B:  0.25; 95% CI: 0.0094, 0.50). Conversely, adherence to the Western pattern (meats,  potatoes, processed foods, and higher-fat dairy products) was associated with more  cognitive decline (B: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.43, -0.032) only in those with low  educational attainment. In summary, among individuals with equivalent diet quality,  the magnitude and characteristics of the diet-cognition relationship depended on  their socioeconomic circumstances. These results suggest that interventions  promoting retention of cognitive function through improved diet quality would  provide maximum benefit to those with relatively low SEP.","2013-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:05:43","","1767-1773","","11","143","","J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23986363","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Animals; Female; Male; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; *Diet; Fruit; Meat; Vegetables; *Cognition; Aging/*physiology; *Feeding Behavior; Quebec; Patient Compliance; Cognition Disorders/epidemiology; Dairy Products; Motor Activity; Poultry; Questionnaires; Food Habits; Cognition Disorders -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, causality remains tenuous  because of the strong possibility of reverse causation (healthy individuals  selectively participate in social activities). We describe a quasi-experimental  intervention in one municipality of Japan designed to boost social participation as  a way of preventing long-term disability in senior citizens through the creation of  'salons' (or community centers). In this quasi-experimental intervention study, we  compared 158 participants with 1391 non-participants in salon programs, and examined  the effect of participation in the salon programs on self-rated health. We conducted  surveys of community residents both before (in 2006) and after (in 2008) the opening  of the salons. Even with a pre/post survey design, our study could be subject to  reverse causation and confounding bias. We therefore utilized an instrumental  variable estimation strategy, using the inverse of the distance between each  resident's dwelling and the nearest salon as the instrument. After controlling for  self-rated health, age, sex, equivalized income in 2006, and reverse causation, we  observed significant correlations between participation in the salon programs and  self-rated health in 2008. Our analyses suggest that participation in the  newly-opened community salon was associated with a significant improvement in  self-rated health over time. The odds ratio of participation in the salon programs  for reporting excellent or good self-rated health in 2008 was 2.52 (95% CI  2.27-2.79). Our study provides novel empirical support for the notion that investing  in community infrastructure to boost the social participation of communities may  help promote healthy aging.","2013-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","83-90","","","94","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Self-report of hearing loss at a primary health-care visit  may offer timely referrals to audiological services, but there has been no  population-based study of self-reported hearing loss in the baby boomer generation.  PURPOSE: To determine the clinical value and audiometric correspondence of  self-reported hearing loss as a screening tool for the baby boomer population.  RESEARCH DESIGN: A population-based study, Busselton Healthy Ageing Study (BHAS),  surveying baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 from the shire of Busselton,  Western Australia. STUDY SAMPLE: A randomized sample of noninstitutionalized  baby-boomers listed on the electoral roll (n = 6690) and resident in the shire are  eligible to participate. This study reports on data from the first 1004 attendees  (53.5% female) with a mean age of 56.23 (SD = 5.43). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:  Data from a self-report question on hearing loss and diagnostic pure tone audiometry  was utilized for this study. Analysis included screening performance measures of  self-report compared to audiometric cut-offs, receiver operator curve (ROC) to  determine optimal level, analysis of variance to compare hearing status to  self-report, and binary logistic regression to determine best audiometric  predictors. RESULTS: Of the sample, 16% self-reported hearing loss (72.1% males).  Logistic regression indicated 4000 Hz as the most important individual frequency  related to self-report while the four-frequency average (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000  Hz) >25 dB in the worse ear was the most significant averaged cutoff with 68%  sensitivity and 87% specificity. Of those who self-reported a hearing loss, 80% had  either a four-frequency average hearing loss >25 dB in the worse ear or a  high-frequency average (4000 and 8000 Hz) hearing loss greater than 35 dB in the  worse ear. CONCLUSIONS: Baby boomer adults who self-report hearing impairment on  direct inquiry are most likely to have a hearing loss. A simple question at a  primary health care visit may facilitate a timely referral for audiological services  in a baby boomer adult, who may be more amenable to rehabilitation.","2013-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:00:12","","514-521; quiz 529","","6","24","","J Am Acad Audiol","","","","","","","","eng","American Academy of Audiology.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23886428","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Cohort Studies; Health Surveys; Logistic Models; Predictive Value of Tests; *Aging; Self Report; ROC Curve; *Health Surveys; *Self Report; Western Australia/epidemiology; Audiometry, Pure-Tone/statistics & numerical data; Data Collection/statistics & numerical data; Hearing Loss/*diagnosis/*epidemiology; Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data; Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Referral and Consultation/statistics & numerical data; Hearing Loss -- epidemiology; Primary Health Care -- statistics & numerical data; Western Australia -- epidemiology; Audiometry, Pure-Tone -- statistics & numerical data; Data Collection -- statistics & numerical data; Hearing Loss -- diagnosis; Mass Screening -- statistics & numerical data; Referral and Consultation -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to identify predictors of  successful ageing. STUDY DESIGN: At baseline (1990-1994), demographic,  anthropometric, health, social connectedness and behavioural data were collected for  41,514 men and women participating in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Only  those born in Australia, New Zealand and UK were included in this analysis. At  follow-up in 2003-2007 data on health conditions, physical disability and  psychological stress were collected and used to define successful ageing. A total of  5512 eligible participants with full data who were aged 70 and over, were included  in this longitudinal analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful ageing at follow-up was  defined as aged 70 years or over and absence of diabetes, heart attack, coronary  artery bypass graft surgery, angioplasty, stroke, cancer; impairment, perceived  major difficulty with physical functioning; and low risk of psychological distress.  RESULTS: A body mass index in the healthy range, low waist/hip ratio, not smoking,  being physically active, and not having arthritis, asthma, hypertension, or  gallstones were associated prospectively with successful ageing. There was no  evidence for an association of social connectedness with successful ageing.  CONCLUSIONS: A healthy lifestyle and maintenance of healthy weight, but not social  connectedness, may improve the chances of ageing successfully by our definition.  Social connectedness may be related to a perception of ageing well, but it does not  appear to help avoid the usual conditions associated with ageing.","2013-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:57:18","","361-366","","4","75","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Because it is thought that nutrition plays an important role in  successful aging, there has been considerable interest in the association between  dietary patterns of older adults and obesity-related health outcomes. OBJECTIVE:  This study examined the association between dietary patterns and mortality and  prevalence of obesity-related health outcomes, namely cardiovascular disease (CVD),  type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn), over a  5-year follow-up period in adults aged 75 years or greater. DESIGN: A longitudinal  observational study with cross-sectional dietary assessment. SETTING: Rural Central  Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (N = 449; 76.5 years  old; 57% female). MEASUREMENTS: Multiple, unannounced, 24-hour dietary recalls were  used to collect dietary intake. Cluster analysis was used to derive dietary  patterns. Prevalence of CVD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and MetSyn was  extracted from outpatient electronic medical records. Logistic regression was used  to examine the associations between dietary patterns and health outcomes and  mortality. RESULTS: 'Sweets and Dairy', 'Health-Conscious' and 'Western' dietary  patterns were identified. Compared to the 'Health-Conscious' pattern, those in the  'Sweets and Dairy' pattern had increased odds of hypertension over the follow-up  period; adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.18 (1.11-4.30). No significant  associations were found for CVD, diabetes mellitus, MetSyn or mortality with dietary  patterns. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the potential value of healthy dietary  patterns in the management of hypertension in older adults. We did not observe any  other strong associations between dietary patterns and health outcomes or mortality  in persons ≥ 75 years of age; thus failing to support the use of overly restrictive  diet prescriptions for older persons, especially where food intake may be  inadequate.","2013","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","566-572","","6","17","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23732554  PMCID: PMC4558554","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Cluster Analysis; Body Mass Index; Nutrition Assessment; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Nutritional Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Prevalence; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Treatment Outcome; *Feeding Behavior; Pennsylvania; Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology/etiology; Hypertension/*epidemiology/etiology; Obesity/complications/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents the results of a case study drawn from a  larger ethnographic community study that set forth to describe how and why elders  from one rural community chose to live in a motel in that same rural community. The  focus of this study is a description of 7 middle-income and affluent rural elders  living in a motel setting as a housing option that enabled them to remain  independent in their community. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a community study  ethnographic design and the strategies of formal and informal interviews,  participant observation, and inductive comparative case study analysis, this study  provides a description of why these elders decided to live in the motel and how this  facilitated their living in the community. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS: Reasons that  these elders decided to live at the motel included ""saving my energy for living,""  ""safety,"" ""connections and privacy,"" and ""the freedom to come and go."" This study  informs elder care policy, emphasizing the importance of naturally occurring  networks to develop community capacity for healthy aging in one rural setting.","2014-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","693-703","","4","54","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","© The Author 2013.

One-year brain changes with a  distinct frontotemporal pattern have been shown in older adults. However, it is not  clear to what extent these changes may have been affected by undetected, early AD.  To address this, we estimated 1-year atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in  132 healthy elderly persons who had remained free of diagnosed mild cognitive  impairment or AD for at least 3 years. We found significant volumetric reductions  throughout the brain. The sample was further divided into low-risk groups based on  clinical, biomarker, genetic, or cognitive criteria. Although sample sizes varied,  significant reductions were observed in all groups, with rates and topographical  distribution of atrophy comparable to that of the full sample. Volume reductions  were especially pronounced in the default mode network, closely matching the  previously described frontotemporal pattern of changes in healthy aging. Atrophy in  the hippocampus predicted change in memory, with no additional default mode network  contributions. In conclusion, reductions in regional brain volumes can be detected  over the course of 1 year even in older adults who are unlikely to be in a  presymptomatic stage of AD.","2013-05-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","8237-8242","","19","33","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23658162  PMCID: PMC4050197","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Regression Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain/*pathology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Apolipoprotein E4/genetics; Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid; *Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease/cerebrospinal fluid/genetics/*pathology; Atrophy/etiology/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rehabilitation services can assist individuals to improve mobility and function after sustaining a  fall-related injury. However, the true effect of fall-related injury resulting in  hospitalisation is often underestimated because of failure to consider sub-acute and  non-acute care provided following the acute hospitalisation episode. AIM: This study  aims to describe the sub-acute and non-acute health service use of individuals  hospitalised in New South Wales (NSW), Australia for a fall-related injury during  2000-01 to 2008-09, to examine the burden of fall-related inpatient rehabilitation  hospital admissions from 1998-99 to 2010-11 and to estimate future demand for  fall-related inpatient rehabilitation admissions in NSW to 2020. METHOD:  Retrospective review of sub-acute and non-acute records linked to hospital admission  records during 2001-02 to 2008-09 in NSW. Analysis of temporal trends from 1998-99  to 2010-11 and projections to 2020 for rehabilitation-related (ICD-10-AM: Z47, Z48,  Z50, Z75.1) inpatient hospital admissions. RESULTS: There were 4317 individuals with  a fall-related injury admitted to hospital and subsequently admitted for sub-acute  and non-acute care; 84% of these were aged 65+ years; 70.4% were female and 27.2%  had femur fractures. For the rehabilitation-related admissions, total mean  functional independence measure (FIM) scores improved significantly (from 78.4 to  94.6; P<0.0001) between admission and discharge. Fall-related inpatient  rehabilitation episodes increased by 9.1% each year between 1998 and 2011 for  individuals aged 65 years and older and are projected to rise to 50000 admissions  annually by 2020. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to provide an epidemiological  profile of individuals using sub-acute and non-acute care in NSW using linked data.  Improvements in data validity and reliability would enhance the quality of the  sub-acute and non-acute care data and its ability to be used to inform resource use  in this sector. The examination of temporal trends using only the inpatient hospital  admissions provides a guide for resource implications for inpatient rehabilitation  services. What is known about this topic? Fall-related injuries that result in  inpatient hospital admissions are increasing in Australia. However, the extent of  the effect of fall-related injuries in the sub-acute and non-acute sector remains  unknown, due to data limitations. What does this paper add? Provides the first  epidemiological profile of individuals who fall and go on to use sub-acute and  non-acute care in NSW using linked data. It highlights where improvements in data  quality in the sub-acute and non-acute care data could be made to improve their  usefulness to inform resource use in this sector. What are the implications for  clinicians? Fall injury prevention and healthy ageing strategies for older  individuals remain a priority for clinicians. The current and projected future  resource implications for inpatient rehabilitation and follow-up services provide an  indication for clinicians of future demand in this area as the population ages.  However, data quality needs to improve to provide clinicians with strongly relevant  guidance to inform clinical practice.","2013-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","348-355","","3","37","","Aust Health Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 23651495","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Retrospective Studies; New South Wales/epidemiology; Accidental Falls/*statistics & numerical data; *Activities of Daily Living; Cost of Illness; *Episode of Care; Medical Record Linkage; Patient Admission; Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/*rehabilitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether diet, assessed in midlife, using dietary patterns and adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), is associated with aging phenotypes, identified after a mean 16-year follow-up.Methods: Data were drawn from the Whitehall II cohort study of 5350 adults (age 51.3±5.3 years, 29.4% women). Diet was assessed at baseline (1991-1993). Mortality, chronic diseases, and functioning were ascertained from hospital data, register linkage, and screenings every 5 years and were used to create 5 outcomes at follow-up: ideal aging (free of chronic conditions and high performance in physical, mental, and cognitive functioning tests; 4%), nonfatal cardiovascular event (12.7%), cardiovascular death (2.8%), noncardiovascular death (7.3%), [corrected] and normal aging (73.2%).Results: Low adherence to the AHEI was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death. In addition, participants with a ""Western-type"" diet (characterized by high intakes of fried and sweet food, processed food and red meat, refined grains, and high-fat dairy products) had lower odds of ideal aging (odds ratio for top vs bottom tertile: 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.94; P=.02), independently of other health behaviors.Conclusions: By considering healthy aging as a composite of cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, mental, and cognitive function, the present study offers a new perspective on the impact of diet on aging phenotypes.","2013-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:48:11","","411-419.e3","","5","126","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Subjects reporting angina, cancer, heart attack or stroke at baseline  (1990-1994) were excluded. Diabetes at baseline was identified by self-report or  elevated plasma glucose (≥ 7.0 mmol/l fasting or ≥ 11.1 mmol/l non-fasting). 6431  eligible men and women had survived to age 70 years at follow-up (2003-2007), and  5704 with complete data were included in these analyses. Those without ischemic  heart disease, stroke, and cancer, no perceived major difficulty with physical  functioning, and no evidence of psychological distress were considered to have aged  successfully, irrespective of diabetes at follow-up (n=1271). Logistic regression  was used to examine the independent association between baseline diabetes and  successful ageing. RESULTS: At baseline 216 eligible people were identified with  diabetes. This was inversely associated with successful ageing at follow-up  independent of smoking, physical activity, alcohol use and obesity (OR 0.65, 95%  0.42-0.99), Of the people with diabetes at follow-up, only 12.5% did not have  another condition characteristic of usual ageing, compared with 22.7% of people who  did not have diabetes.

At baseline and 4 yearly follow-ups, a physician completed the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale on the basis of medical records.Results: Linear mixed-effects models revealed that higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness predicted worse average illness burden longitudinally. Relatively disagreeable persons (25th percentile) accumulated morbidity at a 33% faster rate than agreeable (75th percentile) peers. At the final follow-up, a person at the 75th percentile of neuroticism and the 25th percentile of conscientiousness and agreeableness showed morbidity comparable to a peer of average personality but 10 years older. An individual at the 25th percentile of neuroticism and 75th percentile of conscientiousness and agreeableness showed end-point illness burden comparable to a peer of average personality but 10 years younger. Twenty-one percent of the morbidity associated with neuroticism was explained by total cholesterol. History of hypertension, smoking, alcohol/drug abuse, and affective symptoms of depression each explained 10% or less of the other observed personality effects.Conclusion: Personality plays a nontrivial role in healthy aging among older persons.

The objective for this study was to test  the hypothesis that the onset of widespread pain would be associated with a decrease  in healthy ageing. METHODS: Population-based prospective cohort study. A ""healthy  ageing"" index was constructed across biomedical, physical, psychosocial and lay  components. Analysis was performed with 2949 adults aged 50 years and over who had  complete index scores at baseline, 3 and 6-year follow-ups. RESULTS: At three and  six year follow-up, 365 (16.8%) and 259 (14.3%) experienced the onset of widespread  pain. The onset of widespread pain during the six-year period was associated with a  25% and a 46% decrease in healthy ageing index scores; this decrease was independent  of age, sex, education, social networks, smoking status, alcohol consumption and  physical inactivity. The decrease in healthy ageing attenuated to 20% and 39%  following adjustment for diagnosed musculoskeletal conditions and analgesic and  non-steroidal use. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of widespread pain was associated with a  decrease in healthy ageing throughout the six-year period. When pain increased over  time, the markers of unhealthy ageing increased also. Strong analgesia was  associated with unhealthy ageing. Research could now usefully test whether early  identification, improved treatment and prevention of pain prior to old age may  facilitate healthy ageing.","2013","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:36:17","","e59858","","3","8","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23555810  PMCID: PMC3612101","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; *Aging; Research Design; Pain Measurement; Musculoskeletal Pain/*diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A stroke-free sample of  Hispanic, black, and white participants living in the same community enrolled in a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy of NOMAS, a population-based prospective  cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand two hundred ninety individuals in whom a  cognitive screen was administered at baseline and at enrollment in the MRI substudy.  MEASUREMENTS: SA-ND was based on disease, disability, and cognitive function. The  GVRS includes age, sex, race and ethnicity, waist circumference, alcohol intake,  smoking, physical activity, blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, fasting  blood sugar, lipid levels, and peripheral vascular disease. RESULTS: Data at  baseline and follow-up were available for 1,162 participants (mean age 70 ± 9; 61%  women; 13% white, 16% black, 69% Hispanic; mean GVRS 8.6 ± 0.9).

Results revealed 4 psychosocial aging  profiles with uneven patterns of successful (and less successful) aging  characterized by distinct trajectories of change across indicators of depressive  symptoms, social, and memory functions: a preserved system integrity group of  participants who maintained functioning across very old age; an aging in isolation  group with a persistent lack of social support, and 2 groups of people with average  well-being and social functions but distinctive memory profiles. A compromised  memory group was characterized by poor memory throughout late life, whereas  participants in a memory failing group exhibited dramatic memory declines late in  life. The subgroups were also differentiated by sociodemographic characteristics,  functional limitations, and mortality hazards, which may have served as antecedents,  correlates, or consequents of profile trajectories. We discuss the promises and  challenges of using subgroup-oriented approaches in the study of successful aging.","2013-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:27:58","","2309-2324","","12","49","","Dev Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23527494","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Models, Psychological; Prospective Studies; Psychology; Psychological Tests; Statistics as Topic; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Sweden; *Quality of Life; Aging/*psychology; *Personal Satisfaction; Activities of Daily Living/*psychology; Models, Statistical; Depression/diagnosis/psychology; Goodness of Fit Chi Square Test; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Functional Status -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The centenarian rate (CR) is representative of the general longevity  prevalent in a nation; it indicates the number of individuals aged 100 years or  above at a given date divided by the size of the corresponding cohort of a given  age. Two important attributes of the CR (50-54) are that it reflects both unchanged  age-specific fertility and the absence of migration in populations. It can generally  be used in longevity-based evaluations of the broader concept of successful ageing.  As such, this retrospective analysis of the social factors that contribute to the CR  (50-54) may help to identify the factors associated with successful ageing.This  study estimates the CR (50-54) and elucidates the influence of social factors on  successful ageing and the CR (50-54), examining 32 member countries of the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). METHODS: The social  indicators for this study were obtained from the United Nations database. The data  for the analysis of centenarians in the 32 OECD countries were obtained from the  world population prospects conducted by the United Nations. Associations between  social factors and CR (50-54) were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients  and regression models. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were found between  the CR (50-54) and the social factors of expenditure on health as a percentage of  gross domestic product (HEGDP: r = 0.411, p < 0.021), general government expenditure  on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (GGEH: r = 0.474,  p < 0.006), the proportion of fixed-telephone subscriptions in the population (FTS:  r = 0.489, p < 0.005), and the human development index (HDI: r = 0.486, p < 0.005).  Finally, these CR (50-54) predictors were used to form a model of successful ageing,  with higher HEGDP and GGEH as health expenditure, higher FTS as standard of living,  and higher HDI as social well-being (R2 = 0.573, P < 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The  findings suggest that an increased CR (50-54) is affected by multiple social factors  involved in successful ageing. Therefore, if they wish to improve their country's CR  (50-54), governments must strengthen their existing support services for the elderly  through making improvements to standards of living, social well-being and through  increased financing of the health sector.","2013-03-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","16","","","13","","BMC Int Health Hum Rights","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23497053  PMCID: PMC3599594","","","","Humans; Socioeconomic Factors; Longevity; Life Expectancy; Retrospective Studies; Quality of Life/psychology; Health Expenditures/*standards; Aged, 80 and over/*statistics & numerical data; Centenarian rate, Expenditure on health, Fixed-telephone, Human development index; Human Development/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We considered a broad range of successful aging  indicators and compared older adults with vision impairment, hearing impairment, and  dual sensory impairments and without sensory impairment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data  came from samples of severely visually impaired (VI; N = 121), severely  hearing-impaired (HI; N = 116), dual sensory-impaired (DI; N = 43), and  sensory-unimpaired older adults (UI; N = 150). Participants underwent a wide-ranging  assessment, covering everyday competence, cognitive functioning, social resources,  self-regulation strategies, cognitive and affective well-being, and 4-year survival  status (except the DI group). RESULTS: The most pronounced difference among groups  was in the area of everyday competence (lowest in VI and DI). Multigroup comparisons  in latent space revealed both similar and differing relationship strengths among  health, everyday competence, social resources, self-regulation, and overall  well-being, depending on sensory status. After 4 years, mortality in VI (29%) and HI  (30%) was significantly higher than in UI (20%) at the bivariate level, but not  after controlling for confounders in a multivariate analysis.

Although sitting time  is emerging as a distinct risk factor for chronic disease, research on the  association of sitting time and chronic disease in middle-aged Australian males is  limited. METHODS: A sample of 63,048 males aged 45-64 years was drawn from the  baseline dataset of the 45 and Up Study - a longitudinal cohort study on healthy  ageing with 267,153 participants from across New South Wales, Australia's most  populous state. Baseline data on self-reported chronic disease (heart disease,  cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, combined chronic diseases), sitting time,  physical activity (Active Australia Survey), and a range of covariates were used for  cross-sectional analyses. Crude (OR), partially and fully adjusted odds ratios (AOR)  and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using binary logistic regression.  RESULTS: Compared to those sitting <4 hours/day, participants reporting 4 to <6, 6  to <8, and ≥8 hours were significantly more likely to report ever having any chronic  disease (AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.12, p = 0.050; AOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.16, p =  0.003; AOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.15, p = 0.002, respectively). Participants who  reported 6 to <8 hours and ≥8 hours of sitting were also significantly more likely  to report ever having diabetes than those reporting <4 hours/day (AOR 1.15, 95% CI  1.03 - 1.28, p = 0.016; AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.33, p <0.001, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that higher volumes of sitting time are  significantly associated with diabetes and overall chronic disease, independent of  physical activity and other potentially confounding factors.

This study examined changes in oral health-related quality of life  (OHRQoL) among Japanese elderly over a 7-year period. A sample of independently  living individuals (aged 60+ years) underwent a questionnaire and dental examination  at baseline and 7 years afterwards. The Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index  (GOHAI) was used to assess the impact of oral conditions. Occlusal force and  salivary flow were also assessed. Of the 411 participants assessed at baseline, 130  (31·6%) accepted to participate after 7 years. There were no significant differences  between those lost to follow-up and those assessed at 7 years, except that a higher  proportion of the latter rated their baseline general health as good. Among the  latter, the overall mean GOHAI score did not change significantly (11·8 at baseline  and 11·1 at follow-up; P = 0·16). However, after controlling for age, gender and  baseline GOHAI score, participants who had lost teeth or experienced a decline in  occlusal force after 7 years had higher follow-up GOHAI scores (indicating poorer  OHRQoL). Unfavourable changes in clinical oral status over time are reflected in  poorer self-rated oral health.","2013-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","252-257","","4","40","","J Oral Rehabil","","","","","","","","eng","© 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23356574","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Attitude to Health; Personal Satisfaction; Social Class; *Oral Health; Independent Living; *Quality of Life; Aging/*psychology; Self Concept; Saliva/metabolism; Deglutition/physiology; Bite Force; Eating/physiology; Esthetics, Dental; Secretory Rate/physiology; Tooth Loss/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A secondary objective was to identify the relative  contribution of diet and physical activity to long-term change in HRQoL.  DESIGN/SUBJECTS: Subjects were Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants  trial participants aged 45 to 60 years at inclusion in the cohort. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Compliance with nutrition guidelines (diet and physical activity) was  assessed by the PNNS Guideline Score (maximum 15 points) at inclusion. HRQoL was  measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) at 1 year (initial  measurement) and 13 years (final measurement) after inclusion. The primary end point  was change in the SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component  summary (MCS) scores over 12 years. RESULTS: In total, 3,005 subjects (mean age 51.4  ± 4.3 years) completed the SF-36 at the initial and final measurement. The mean PNNS  Guideline Score was 7.8 ± 1.9 and the mean PCS and MCS was 52.2 ± 6.4 and 50.3 ±  7.0, respectively, at the initial measurement and 48.0 ± 9.6 and 51.2 ± 8.7 at the  final measurement. Better compliance with nutritional guidelines was associated with  better initial and final HRQoL but not associated with change in HRQoL. Compliance  with dietary guidelines was associated with positive change in PCS score but not  associated with initial PCS score. In contrast, compliance with dietary guidelines  was related to positive initial MCS score but not related to change in MCS score.  Compliance with physical activity guidelines was related to initial PCS and MCS  scores but not related to change in PCS and MCS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Following  physical activity guidelines may be associated with better concomitant HRQoL and  following dietary guidelines with better future physical HRQoL.","2013-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:47:28","","228-240.e1-2","","2","113","","J Acad Nutr Diet","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2007-2010, the Chicago Healthy  Aging Study reexamined a subset of participants aged 65 to 84 years from the Chicago  Heart Association Detection Project in Industry cohort (baseline examination,  1967-1973). RF groups were defined as LR (untreated blood pressure ≤ 120/≤ 80 mm Hg,  untreated serum cholesterol <200 mg/dL, body mass index <25 kg/m(2), not smoking, no  diabetes) or as 0 RFs, 1 RF, or 2+ RFs based on the presence of blood pressure ≥  140/≥ 90 mm Hg or receiving treatment, serum cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dL or receiving  treatment, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2), smoking, or diabetes. ABI at follow-up was  categorized as indicating PAD present (≤ 0.90), as borderline PAD (0.91 to 0.99), or  as normal (1.00 to 1.40). We included 1346 participants with ABI ≤ 1.40. After  multivariable adjustment, the presence of fewer baseline RFs was associated with a  lower likelihood of PAD at 39-year follow-up (P for trend is <0.001). Odds ratios  (95% CIs) for PAD in persons with LR, 0 RFs, or 1 RF compared with those with 2+ RFs  were 0.14 (0.05 to 0.44), 0.28 (0.13 to 0.59), and 0.33 (0.16 to 0.65),  respectively; findings were similar for borderline PAD (P for trend is 0.005). The  association was mainly due to baseline smoking status, cholesterol, and diabetes.  Remaining free of adverse RFs or improving RF status over time was also associated  with PAD.

A multidimensional survey was also  administered, which included questions relating to sociodemographic variables,  self-reported hearing difficulties, nutrition, smoking habits and level of social  activity. RESULTS: Although there was a general increase in hearing difficulties  over time, older age, poor nutrition, a lifetime of smoking and increased social  activity predicted more rapid increases in hearing difficulty over time.

In this context, the determination of inter-session reliability of these networks is  crucial. However, data on network reliability in healthy elderly subjects is rare  and does not exist for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a  prodromal stage of AD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the  long-term test-retest reliability of RSNs in both groups. Twelve healthy controls  (HC) and 13 aMCI patients underwent resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological  testing (CERAD test battery) twice, at baseline and after 13-16 months.  Resting-state fMRI data was decomposed into independent components using independent  component analysis. Inter-session test-retest reliability of the resulting RSNs was  determined by calculating voxel-wise intra-class correlation coefficients. Overall  test-retest reliability of corresponding RSNs was moderate to high in both groups,  but significantly higher in the HC group compared to the aMCI group (p < 0.001),  while the cognitive performance within the CERAD test battery remained stable over  time in either group. Most reliable RSNs derived from the HC group and were  associated with sensory and motor as well as higher order cognitive and the  default-mode function. Particularly low reliability was found in basal frontal  regions, which are known to be prone to susceptibility-induced noise. We conclude  that stable RSNs may represent healthy aging, whereas decreased RSN reliability may  indicate progressive neuro-functional alterations before the actual manifestation of  clinical symptoms.","2013","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:39:57","","741-754","","3","34","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 23271315","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Cognitive Dysfunction/*diagnosis/*psychology; Neuropsychological Tests/*standards; Amnesia/*diagnosis/*psychology; Middle Age; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Amnesia -- Diagnosis; Amnesia -- Psychosocial Factors; Neuropsychological Tests -- Standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Muscle strength was greater in men than in women at every age by decade, and muscle  strength in men in their 80s was similar to that in women in their 40s. Therefore,  the effect of a decrease in muscle strength on daily physical performance was  greater in women than men. On the other hand, the muscle volume of all limbs  decreased with age in men, but there was almost no decrease in muscle volume in  women. These results indicate that qualitative change in muscle was more significant  than quantitative change in muscle in women. Daily physical performance was  influenced by muscle performance and could be assessed based on grip power and  walking speed.

Personality traits are associated with drug  use; we test whether these associations vary by socioeconomic status. METHOD:  Participants (N=412) from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the  Life Span (HANDLS) study completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and  self-reported use of opiates and cocaine. 50% of participants were living below 125%  of the federal poverty line. Mean-level personality differences across never,  former, and current opiate/cocaine users were compared. Logistic regressions  compared never versus current users and interactions between personality traits and  poverty status tested whether these associations varied by socioeconomic status.  RESULTS: High Neuroticism and low Agreeableness increased risk of drug use. The  association between low Conscientiousness and drug use was moderated by poverty,  such that low Conscientiousness was a stronger risk factor for illicit substance use  among those with relatively higher SES. For every standard deviation decrease in  Conscientiousness, there was a greater than 2-fold increase in risk of illicit  substance use (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.45-3.17). Conscientiousness was unrelated to drug  use among participants living below 125% of the federal poverty line. CONCLUSIONS:  Under favorable economic conditions, the tendency to be organized, disciplined, and  deliberate is protective against drug use. These tendencies, however, matter less  when financial resources are scarce. In contrast, those prone to emotional distress  and antagonism are at greater risk for current drug use, regardless of their  economic situation.","2013-08-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:22:06","","247-251","","3","131","","Drug Alcohol Depend","","","","","","","","eng","Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","","","","","","PMID: 23265091  PMCID: PMC3610771","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Personality; Poverty; *Personality; *Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical data; *Population Surveillance/methods; Cocaine; Conscientiousness; Heroin; Illicit Drugs/*economics; Personality traits; Poverty/*economics/psychology; Substance use; Substance-Related Disorders/diagnosis/*economics/psychology; Illicit Drugs; Population Surveillance -- methods; Illicit Drugs -- economics; Personality Inventory -- statistics & numerical data; Poverty -- economics; Poverty -- psychology; Substance-Related Disorders -- diagnosis; Substance-Related Disorders -- economics; Substance-Related Disorders -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines the risk of progression from mild to severe cognitive impairment in relation to engagement in social activities while mildly impaired and the concurrence of subsequent change in engagement with MCI progression.Methods: Participants were 816 older adults with cognitively defined MCI (mean age 78.0 (standard deviation or SD = 7.4) years) from the Monongahela-Youghiogheny Healthy Aging Team (MYHAT) Study--a prospective cohort study of MCI in the community. Over three years of follow-up, 78 individuals progressed from MCI to severe cognitive impairment, while 738 did not progress. Risk of progression was estimated using discrete time survival analyses. The main predictors were standardized composite measures of the variety and frequency of engagement in social activities.Results: Lower risk of progression from mild to severe cognitive impairment was associated with both a greater level of frequency of engagement in social activities while mildly impaired (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.55-0.93, p = 0.01) and also with a slower rate of decline in the variety of activities over time (OR = 0.01, 95% CI: <0.001-0.38, p = 0.02).Conclusions: Greater engagement in social activities may potentially be beneficial for preventing or delaying further cognitive decline among older adults with MCI.

We addressed this in 3 ways. First, age trajectories of  cortical thickness were delineated cross-sectionally (n = 1100) and longitudinally  (n = 207). Second, effects of undetected AD on the age trajectories were simulated  by mixing the sample with a sample of patients with very mild to moderate AD. Third,  atrophy in AD-vulnerable regions was examined in older adults with very low  probability of incipient AD based on 2-year neuropsychological stability, CSF  Aβ(1-42) levels, and apolipoprotein ε4 negativity. Steady decline was seen in most  regions, but accelerated cortical thinning in entorhinal cortex was observed across  groups. Very low-risk older adults had longitudinal entorhinal atrophy rates similar  to other healthy older adults, and this atrophy was predictive of memory change.  While steady decline in cortical thickness is the norm in aging, acceleration in  AD-prone regions does not uniquely signify neurodegenerative illness but can be part  of healthy aging. The relationship between the entorhinal changes and changes in  memory performance suggests that non-AD mechanisms in AD-prone areas may still be  causative for cognitive reductions.","2014-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","919-934","","4","24","","Cereb Cortex","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23236213  PMCID: PMC3948495","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Age Factors; aging; *Aging; Young Adult; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Disease Progression; Amyloid beta-Peptides/cerebrospinal fluid; Peptide Fragments/cerebrospinal fluid; magnetic resonance imaging; Alzheimer Disease/complications; Alzheimer's disease; atrophy; Cerebral Cortex/*pathology; cortical thickness; Dementia/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings, however, have been inconsistent. This study investigates these associations in individuals who ranged in age from approximately 70 to 73 years.Methods: Participants were from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 818). Acute-phase proteins-CRP and fibrinogen-were measured at ages approximately 70 years (first wave) and 73 years (second wave), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was measured at age 73 years. Personality traits were measured at age 70 years using two instruments, the International Personality Item Pool and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory.Results: Lower International Personality Item Pool conscientiousness was cross-sectionally associated with elevated CRP, such that 1 standard deviation higher conscientiousness was associated with 22% lower odds of having a CRP level greater than 3 mg/l (odds ratio = 0.78; 95% confidence interval = 0.67-0.91). NEO Five-Factor Inventory openness was negatively associated with CRP (odds ratio = 0.79; 95% confidence interval = 0.67-0.94) and IL-6 (β = -.08, p = .045) at age 73 years; these associations were attenuated by 26% and 63%, respectively, after adjusting for social background and prior cognitive ability. Body mass index mediated some (14%-18%) of the conscientiousness-inflammation association, whereas common health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity did not significantly mediate the personality trait-inflammatory marker association.Conclusions: The findings add some support to accumulating evidence for low conscientiousness being linked to higher levels of inflammation and poorer general health.","2013-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:21:54","","11-19","","1","75","","Psychosom Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23197841","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Aging; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Health Behavior; Prospective Studies; Aging -- blood; Biomarkers; Odds Ratio; Biomarkers -- blood; 9007-41-4; C-Reactive Protein; C-Reactive Protein -- analysis; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-6 -- blood; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Smoking/epidemiology; inflammation; Personality; Biomarkers/blood; Alcohol Drinking/epidemiology; Interleukin-6/*blood; Personality/*physiology; Scotland; Personality Inventory; Scotland/epidemiology; interleukin-6; personality traits; Aging/blood/psychology; C-Reactive Protein/*analysis; Fibrinogen/analysis; Inflammation/*blood; Smoking -- epidemiology; Scotland -- epidemiology; IL6 protein, human; 9001-32-5; Alcohol Drinking -- epidemiology; Fibrinogen; Fibrinogen -- analysis; Inflammation -- blood; Personality -- physiology; Alcohol Drinking -- Epidemiology; Inflammation -- Blood; C-Reactive Protein -- Analysis; Interleukins -- Blood; Biological Markers -- Blood; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Personality Tests; Fibrinogen -- Analysis; Myers-Briggs Type Indicator; C-reactive protein, fibrinogen; conscientiousness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chronic HF is accompanied  by co-morbidities that influence the quality of life and outcomes. METHODS AND  RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 200 patients with chronic HF. The appendicular  skeletal muscle mass of the arms and the legs combined, was assessed by dual energy  X-ray absorptiometry. We analysed the muscle strength in arms and legs, and all  patients underwent a 6-min walk test, a 4-m walk test, and spiroergometry testing.  Muscle wasting was defined as the appendicular muscle mass 2 SD below the mean of a  healthy reference group of adults aged 18-40 years, as suggested for the diagnosis  of muscle wasting in healthy ageing (sarcopenia). Muscle wasting was detected in 39  (19.5%) subjects. Patients with muscle wasting had significantly lower values for  handgrip and quadriceps strength as well as lower total peak oxygen consumption  (peakVO2, 1173 ± 433 vs. 1622 ± 456 mL/min), lower exercise time (7.7 ± 3.8 vs.  10.22 ± 3.0 min, both P < 0.001), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF, P = 0.05) than patients without. The distance walked during 6 min and the  gait speed during the 4-m walk were lower in patients with muscle wasting (both P <  0.05). Serum levels of interleukin-6 were significantly elevated in patients with  muscle wasting (P = 0.001). Logistic regression showed muscle wasting to be  independently associated with reduced peak VO2 adjusted for age, sex, New York Heart  Association class, haemoglobin, LVEF, distance walked in 6 minutes, and the number  of co-morbidities (odds ratio 6.53, p = 0.01).

In this study, we examined the relationship  between depressive symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected  cerebrovascular disease in a normal population living independently in the  community, and measured the influence of location of brain abnormalities, fluid  intelligence, living alone, and sex. METHODS: Prospective cohort: 497 community  dwelling individuals all born in 1936, who took part in the Scottish Mental Survey  of 1947, were followed up in 2000 and at biannual intervals in a longitudinal study  of health and cognitive aging. Two hundred forty-four volunteered for brain MRI in  2004-2006. Suitable data were available in 219/244, of whom 115 were men. Brain  hyperintensities in lobar white matter, basal ganglia , periventricular, and  infratentorial regions were measured using Scheltens' scale. Depressed mood was  assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on three biannual  intervals. Relationships between Scheltens' scores, HADS-D scores, fluid  intelligence, living alone, and sex were assessed using general linear modeling.  RESULTS: The main predictor of depressive symptom scores was poorer fluid  intelligence (partial η(2) =0.023-0.028, P < .05). Ischemic change in the brainstem  (partial η(2) = 0.026, P ≤.05) and basal ganglia (partial η(2) =0.018, P ≤ .05) also  predicted HADS-D scores. There was no relationship with sex or living alone.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1758-535X 1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/gls220","","BACKGROUND: A reduction in maximal stroke volume (SVmax) and total blood volume (TBV) has been hypothesized to contribute to the decline in maximal oxygen uptake  (VO2max) with healthy aging. However, these variables have rarely been collected  simultaneously in a board age range to support or refute this hypothesis. It is also  unclear to what extent scaling size-related cardiovascular determinants of VO2max  affects the interpretation of age-related differences. METHODS: A retrospective  analysis of VO2max, maximal cardiac output (QCmax), TBV, and body composition  including fat-free mass (FFM) in 95 (51% M) healthy adults ranging from 19-86 years.  RESULTS: Absolute and indexed VO2max, QCmax, and maximal heart rate decreased in  both sexes with age (p ≤ .031). SVmax declined with age when scaled to total body  mass or body surface area (p ≤ .047) but not when expressed in absolute levels (p =  .120) or relative to FFM (p = .464). Absolute and indexed TBVs (mL/kg; mL/m(2)) were  not significantly affected by age but increased with age in both sexes when scaled  to FFM (p ≤ .013). A lower arteriovenous oxygen difference (a-vO2diff) contributed  to the reduction in VO2max with age in treadmill exercisers (p = .004) but not in  the entire cohort (p = .128). CONCLUSION: These results suggest (a) a reduction in  absolute SVmax, and TBV do not contribute substantially to the age-related reduction  in VO2max, which instead results from a smaller QCmax due to a lower maximal heart  rate, and (b) body composition scaling methods should be used to accurately describe  the effect of aging on physical function and cardiovascular variables.","2013-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","608-616","","5","68","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23160363  PMCID: PMC3623484","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Age Factors; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; *Body Composition; *Body Size; *Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Oxygen Consumption/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Longitudinal study designs are needed to specify the dynamics of BF  degeneration in the transition from normal aging to AD. We applied recently  developed techniques for in vivo volumetry of the BF to serial magnetic resonance  imaging scans of 82 initially healthy elderly individuals (60-93 years) and 50  patients with very mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating score = 0.5) that were  clinically followed over an average of 3 ± 1.5 years. BF atrophy rates were found to  be significantly higher than rates of global brain shrinkage even in cognitively  stable healthy elderly individuals. Compared with healthy control subjects, very  mild AD patients showed reduced BF volumes at baseline and increased volume loss  over time. Atrophy of the BF was more pronounced in progressive patients compared  with those that remained stable. The cholinergic BF undergoes disproportionate  degeneration in the aging process, which is further increased by the presence of AD.","2013-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1210-1220","","4","34","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Some findings  on their electrocardiograms (ECGs) are simply age-related and others mirror  underlying diseases. We aimed to identify ECG features truly associated with extreme  age. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 55 centenarians hospitalized between January  2000 and June 2010. Each centenarian was matched with three octogenarians according  to gender, presence of hypertension, aortic stenosis, heart failure, and ischemic  heart disease. RESULTS: A history of hypertension was present in 32 (58%)  centenarians, aortic stenosis in 6 (11%), heart failure in 8 (15%), and ischemic  heart disease in 6 (11%). Centenarians had a higher heart rate than octogenarians  (81 ± 15 bpm vs. 72 ± 15 bpm, respectively, P  <  0.001) but were less frequently on  beta-blockers (7% vs. 36%, respectively, P < 0.001).

Participants were free of cancer, coronary artery disease and stroke when their health behaviours were assessed in 1991-1994 as part of the Whitehall II study. We defined healthy behaviours as never smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity (≥ 2.5 h/wk moderate physical activity or ≥ 1 h/wk vigorous physical activity), and eating fruits and vegetables daily. We defined successful aging, measured over a median 16.3-year follow-up, as good cognitive, physical, respiratory and cardiovascular functioning, in addition to the absence of disability, mental health problems and chronic disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes).Results: At the end of follow-up, 549 participants had died and 953 qualified as aging successfully. Compared with participants who engaged in no healthy behaviours, participants engaging in all 4 healthy behaviours had 3.3 times greater odds of successful aging (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-5.1).

When missing data were considered in the analysis, the results were similar to those of our main analysis.Interpretation: Although individual healthy behaviours are moderately associated with successful aging, their combined impact is substantial.

The analysis, using latent change score models, revealed that older  age at Time 1 was related to steeper declines in network structure and social  engagement, but was unrelated to changes in emotional support. Furthermore, levels  of social engagement and levels of emotional support predicted changes in functional  health and life satisfaction with equal strength. Changes in social engagement were  associated with changes in life satisfaction, positive affect, functional health,  and subjective health. Changes in emotional support were only associated with  changes in negative affect. Mediation analyses suggested that network structure may  stimulate social engagement and emotional support, thereby exerting indirect  influences on key aspects of successful aging. The results underscore the importance  of considering the multifaceted nature of social relations in understanding their  impact on distinct developmental goals, and across different domains of successful  aging.","2013-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:40:51","","3-16","","1","28","","Psychol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 23066804","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Personal Satisfaction; Germany; Individuality; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Social Support; *Health Status; Aging/*psychology; *Personal Satisfaction; Affect/*physiology; Affect; Health Surveys/economics; Longitudinal Studies/economics; Middle Age; Support, Psychosocial; Cost Benefit Analysis; Prospective Studies -- Economics; Surveys -- Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was  hypothesised that Indian Asian and African Caribbean people would experience higher  rates of disability compared with Europeans. METHODS: Data was collected from 888  European, 636 Indian Asian and 265 African Caribbean men and women, aged 58-88 years  at 20-year follow-up of community-based cohort study, based in West London.  Disability was measured using a performance-based locomotor function test and  self-reported questionnaires on functional limitation, and instrumental (IADL) and  basic activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants  at follow-up was 69.6 (6.2) years. Compared with Europeans, Indian Asian people were  significantly more likely to experience all of the disability outcomes than  Europeans; this persisted after adjustment for socioeconomic, behavioural, adiposity  and chronic disease risk factors measured at baseline (locomotor dysfunction:  adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.56-3.11; functional limitation: OR 2.77,  2.01-3.81; IADL impairment: OR 3.12, 2.20-4.41; ADL impairment: OR 1.58, 1.11-2.24).  In contrast, a modest excess risk of disability was observed in African Caribbeans,  which was abolished after adjustment (e.g. locomotor dysfunction: OR 1.37,  0.90-1.91); indeed a reduced risk of ADL impairment appeared after multivariable  adjustment (OR from 0.99, 0.68-1.45 to 0.59, 0.38-0.93), compared with Europeans.  CONCLUSIONS: Substantially elevated risk of disability was observed among Indian  Asian participants, unexplained by known factors. A greater understanding of  determinants of disability and normative functional beliefs of healthy aging is  required in this population to inform intervention efforts to prevent disability.","2012","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:54:39","","e45602","","9","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23029128  PMCID: PMC3460991","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Ethnic Groups; Prevalence; Activities of Daily Living; Disabled Persons/*statistics & numerical data; *Ethnic Groups; Disabled Persons -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study  describes the distribution and clustering of 15 common clinical disorders requiring  medical treatment or supervision in a representative British cohort approaching  retirement, and how health tracked across adulthood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The data  come from a cohort of 2661 men and women, 84% of the target sample, followed since  birth in England, Scotland and Wales in 1946, and assessed at 60-64 years for:  cardio and cerebro-vascular disease, hypertension, raised cholesterol, renal  impairment, diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, anaemia, respiratory  disease, liver disease, psychiatric problems, cancers, atrial fibrillation on ECG  and osteoporosis. We calculated the proportions disorder-free, with one or more  disorders, and the level of undiagnosed disorders; and how these disorders cluster  into latent classes and relate to health assessed at 36 years. Participants had, on  average, two disorders (range 0-9); only 15% were disorder-free. The commonest  disorders were hypertension (54.3%, 95% CI 51.8%-56.7%), obesity (31.1%,  28.8%-33.5%), raised cholesterol (25.6%, 23.1-28.26%), and diabetes or impaired  fasting glucose (25.0%, 22.6-27.5%). A cluster of one in five individuals had a high  probability of cardio-metabolic disorders and were twice as likely than others to  have been in the poorest health at 36 years. The main limitations are that the  native born sample is entirely white, and a combination of clinical assessments and  self reports were used. CONCLUSIONS: Most British people reaching retirement already  have clinical disorders requiring medical supervision. Widening disease definitions  and the move from a disease-based to a risk-based medical model will increase  pressure on health services. The promotion of healthy ageing should start earlier in  life and consider the individual's ability to adapt to and self manage changes in  health.","2012","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 20:15:41","","1","","9","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 23028647  PMCID: PMC3447001","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Cluster Analysis; Adult; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Disease; Sex Distribution; Self Report; England/epidemiology; Parturition; Age Distribution; *Disease; *Parturition; *World War II; Retirement/*statistics & numerical data; England -- epidemiology; Retirement -- statistics & numerical data; World War II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those rational models  only partly fit with today's view and practice of health promotion, where programmes  can be considered as processes because they are guided by principles such as  community participation and intersectoral collaboration. The aim of this paper is to  provide a comprehensive view on approaches to planning in health promotion practice.  To investigate these, Whittington's typology has been used. Whittington identifies  four approaches to planning, i.e. classical, evolutionary, processual and systemic.  In a retrospective multiple case study, we describe actual planning processes used  in the development and implementation of a healthy ageing programme in three Dutch  municipalities. These processes were described using data gathered by: interviews,  participant observation and document analysis, and external auditing.  Characteristics of the four planning approaches were used to interpret the data. The  results show that, in practice, all forms of planning approaches were used,  depending on the degree of complexity and dynamics of the context, the phase of the  health promotion programme, and the time available. Our findings suggest that in the  emergent practice of health promotion different approaches to planning are used. To  make those planning approaches explicit and manageable for practice and science,  discussion and reflection between stakeholders are essential.","2014-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","328-338","","2","29","","Health Promot Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 23014261","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Socioeconomic Factors; Program Development; *Aging; Retrospective Studies; Netherlands; Independent Living; complexity; Cooperative Behavior; Health Promotion/*organization & administration; Home Care Services/organization & administration; Mental Health Services/organization & administration; planning models; systemic planning; Whittington's typology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Baseline data are from respondents (n = 19,662) to the 1998 wave of the HRS. Twelve distinct health behavior profiles were created, based on each respondent's smoking, physical activity, and alcohol use status in 1998. Mortality risk was estimated through 2008 using Cox regression.Results: Smoking was associated with elevated risk for mortality within all behavioral profiles, but risk was greatest when combined with heavy drinking, both for middle-aged (ages 51-65) and older (ages 66+) adults. Profiles that included physical inactivity were also associated with increased mortality risk in both age groups. However, the impact of inactivity was clearly evident only among non-smokers; among smokers, the risk of inactivity was less evident, and seemingly overshadowed by the risk of smoking. Moderate drinking was protective relative to abstinence among non-smokers, and relative to heavy drinking among smokers.Conclusions: In both middle-aged and older adults, multiple unhealthy behaviors increase mortality risk. However, the level of risk varies across unique combinations of unhealthy behaviors. These findings highlight the role that lifestyle improvements could play in promoting healthy aging, and provide insight into which behavioral combinations should receive top priority for intervention.","2012-09-18","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:17:29","","803-803","","1","12","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22989155  PMCID: PMC3503621","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; United States; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Human; United States/epidemiology; *Sedentary Behavior; *Risk-Taking; Alcohol-Related Disorders/*mortality; Smoking/*mortality; Middle Age; Regression; Alcohol-Related Disorders -- Mortality; Life Style, Sedentary; Risk Taking Behavior; Smoking -- Mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cognitive ability at age 11 years, cognitive ability in later life, or lifetime cognitive change are associated with mental wellbeing in older people.METHODSWe used data on 8191 men and women aged 50 to 87 years from four cohorts in the HALCyon collaborative research programme into healthy ageing: the Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921, the National Child Development Survey, and the MRC National Survey for Health and Development. We used linear regression to examine associations between cognitive ability at age 11, cognitive ability in later life, and lifetime change in cognitive ability and mean score on the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each.RESULTSPeople whose cognitive ability at age 11 was a standard deviation above the mean scored 0.53 points higher on the mental wellbeing scale (95% confidence interval 0.36, 0.71). The equivalent value for cognitive ability in later life was 0.89 points (0.72, 1.07). A standard deviation improvement in cognitive ability in later life relative to childhood ability was associated with 0.66 points (0.39, 0.93) advantage in wellbeing score. These effect sizes equate to around 0.1 of a standard deviation in mental wellbeing score. Adjustment for potential confounding and mediating variables, primarily the personality trait neuroticism, substantially attenuated these associations.CONCLUSIONAssociations between cognitive ability in childhood or lifetime cognitive change and mental wellbeing in older people are slight and may be confounded by personality trait differences.","2012","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:03:41","","e44860","","9","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22970320  PMCID: PMC3438162","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Mental Health; Child; *Cognition; *Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from the Québec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful  Aging, the objectives were to: 1) determine the reproducibility of circulating  phylloquinone over 2 y (n = 234); 2) calculate how a single measurement would rank  or classify individuals and attenuate the regression coefficient between circulating  phylloquinone and a health outcome; and 3) investigate the association of a single  measurement of serum phylloquinone with long-term phylloquinone intakes assessed  over the year prior to the blood draw (n = 228). The variance analysis based on 2  blood samples showed a fair to good reproducibility for serum phylloquinone  (intra-class correlation = 0.49). The correlation coefficient between the ranking of  individuals based on a single measurement of circulating phylloquinone and the  ""true"" ranking would be 0.70. The multiple regression analysis showed that long-term  phylloquinone intake was the strongest predictor of serum phylloquinone (t = 4.94; P  < 0.001). The partial correlation coefficient (r = 0.32) was comparable with those  reported in studies where blood sampling and diet recording were juxtaposed and/or  multiple blood samples were used.

Using an eye-tracking task (the gap-overlap  paradigm), we examined whether the uncorrected errors relate to the task of  attentional disengagement in preparation for action. Alternatively, the difficulty  in correcting for errors may be caused by the working memory representation of the  task. A major aim of this study was to distinguish between the effects of healthy  aging and neurodegenerative disease on the voluntary control of saccadic eye  movements. Using the antisaccade task (AST) and pro-saccade task (PST) with the  'gap' and 'overlap' procedures, we obtained detailed eye-tracking measures in  patients, with 18 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, 25 patients with  Parkinson's disease and 17 healthy young and 18 old participants. Uncorrected errors  in the AST were selectively increased in Alzheimer's disease, but not in Parkinson's  disease compared to the control groups. These uncorrected errors were strongly  correlated with spatial working memory. There was an increase in the saccade  reaction times to targets that were presented simultaneously with the fixation  stimulus, compared to the removal of fixation. This 'gap' effect (i.e. overlap-gap)  saccade reaction time was elevated in the older groups compared to young group,  which yielded a strong effect of aging and no specific effect of neurodegenerative  disease. Healthy aging, rather than neurodegenerative disease, accounted for the  increase in the saccade reaction times to the target that are presented  simultaneously with a fixation stimulus. These results suggest that the impairment  of inhibitory control in the AST may provide a convenient and putative mark of  working memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.","2013-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1637-1650","","5","35","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22903189  PMCID: PMC3776119","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Disease Progression; Aging/*physiology; Attention/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Alzheimer Disease/*physiopathology; Saccades/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study also tested the implication of Fredrickson's Broaden and Build Theory (1998, 2001) that positive emotions (happiness) might serve to 'undo' the detrimental effects of negative emotions (loneliness). Method: Participants (n = 228; 62% female; aged 77-96 years) took part in the Aging in Manitoba Study (2001) and the Successful Aging Study (2003). Mortality information was assessed in 2008. Results: Regression analyses showed that loneliness longitudinally predicted perceived physical activity and mortality. Moreover, in support of Fredrickson's theory, happiness moderated these relationships, suggesting that happiness had the power to 'undo' the detrimental effects of loneliness on activity and mortality. Conclusions: Loneliness is an independent risk factor for mortality and reduced physical activity among older adults; however, being happy may offset the negative consequences of being lonely.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between  menopausal hormone therapy and high blood pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of  43,405 postmenopausal women were included in the study. Baseline data for these  women were sourced from the 45 and Up Study, Australia, a large scale study of  healthy ageing. These women reported being postmenopausal, having an intact uterus,  and had not been diagnosed with high blood pressure prior to menopause. Odds ratios  for the association between MHT use and having high blood pressure were estimated  using logistic regression, stratified by age (<56 years, 56-61 years, 62-70 years  and over 71 years) and adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors. MHT use was  associated with higher odds of having high blood pressure: past menopausal hormone  therapy use: <56 years (adjusted odds ratio 1.59, 99% confidence interval 1.15 to  2.20); 56-61 years (1.58, 1.31 to 1.90); 62-70 years (1.26, 1.10 to 1.44). Increased  duration of hormone use was associated with higher odds of having high blood  pressure, with the effect of hormone therapy use diminishing with increasing age.  CONCLUSIONS: Menopausal hormone therapy use is associated with significantly higher  odds of having high blood pressure, and the odds increase with increased duration of  use. High blood pressure should be conveyed as a health risk for people considering  MHT use.","2012","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:34:45","","e40260","","7","7","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22808129  PMCID: PMC3394783","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Health; Risk Factors; Female; Cohort Studies; Demography; Odds Ratio; Age Distribution; Hormone Replacement Therapy/*adverse effects; Hypertension/*etiology; Postmenopause/*physiology; Hormone Replacement Therapy -- adverse effects; Hypertension -- etiology; Postmenopause -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There was evidence for linkage on  6q25-27 near the fragile site FRA6E region with a dominant model maximum multipoint  heterogeneity LOD score = 3.2. The 1-LOD-down support interval for this linkage  contained one SNP for which there was regionally significant evidence of association  (rs205990, p = 2.36 × 10(-5)). This marker survived interval-wide Bonferroni  correction for multiple testing and was located between the genes QKI and PDE10A.  Other areas of chromosome 6q25-q27 (including the FRA6E region) contained several  SNPs associated with SA (minimum p = 2.89 × 10(-6)). These findings suggest  potentially novel genes in the 6q25-q27 region linked and associated with SA in the  Amish; however, these findings should be verified in an independent replication  cohort.","2013-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1467-1477","","4","35","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22773346  PMCID: PMC3705095","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Incidence; Prospective Studies; Phenotype; Aging/*genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Amish/*genetics; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics; Dementia/*ethnology/*genetics; Genetic Linkage/*genetics; Genome-Wide Association Study; Indiana/epidemiology; Lod Score; Ohio/epidemiology; Pedigree","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent overseas evidence suggests relatively high levels of wellbeing in this group, however little is known about people of advanced age, particularly the indigenous Māori, in Aotearoa, New Zealand. This paper outlines the methods of the study Life and Living in Advanced Age: A Cohort Study in New Zealand. The study aimed to establish predictors of successful advanced ageing and understand the relative importance of health, frailty, cultural, social & economic factors to successful ageing for Māori and non-Māori in New Zealand.Methods/design: A total population cohort study of those of advanced age. Two cohorts of equal size, Māori aged 80-90 and non-Māori aged 85, oversampling to enable sufficient power, were enrolled. A defined geographic region, living in the Bay of Plenty and Lakes District Health Board areas of New Zealand, defined the sampling frame. Rūnanga (Māori tribal organisations) and Primary Health Organisations were subcontracted to recruit on behalf of the University. Measures--a comprehensive interview schedule was piloted and administered by a trained interviewer using standardised techniques. Socio-demographic and personal history included tribal affiliation for Māori and participation in cultural practices; physical and psychological health status used standardised validated research tools; health behaviours included smoking, alcohol use and nutrition risk; and environmental data included local amenities, type of housing and neighbourhood. Social network structures and social support exchanges are recorded. Measures of physical function; gait speed, leg strength and balance, were completed. Everyday interests and activities, views on ageing and financial interests complete the interview. A physical assessment by a trained nurse included electrocardiograph, blood pressure, hearing and vision, anthropometric measures, respiratory function testing and blood samples.Discussion: A longitudinal study of people of advanced age is underway in New Zealand. The health status of a population based sample of older people will be established and predictors of successful ageing determined.","2012-06-29","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:43:27","","33","","","12","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22747503  PMCID: PMC3502153","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Feasibility Studies; Aging/*ethnology/psychology; *Quality of Life/psychology; Health Behavior/*ethnology; New Zealand/ethnology; Oceanic Ancestry Group/*ethnology/psychology; Questionnaires; Pilot Studies; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Aboriginal Australians; Aboriginal Australians -- Psychosocial Factors; Health Behavior -- Ethnology; New Zealand -- Ethnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical support for the  beneficial effects of PA on vasomotor symptoms has, however, been mixed. The purpose  of this study was to assess the effects of acute aerobic exercise and daily PA on  menopausal vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: Community-dwelling midlife women (N = 121;  age range, 40-60 y) not using hormone therapy were recruited for a 15-day daily  diary study. Women completed psychological, cardiorespiratory fitness, body  composition, and hormonal status screening followed by a 15-day prospective  assessment in a ""real-life"" setting using a personal digital assistant. Participants  also completed a 30-minute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise bout on a treadmill  between days 5 and 8. Daily PA was assessed objectively through accelerometry, and  all symptomatic women (n = 92) completed two 24-hour Biolog sternal skin conductance  recordings of hot flashes (HFs)-one at baseline and one immediately after treadmill  exercise. RESULTS: Both total objective (P = 0.054) and total subjective (P < 0.05)  HFs decreased after the acute exercise bout. At the between-person level, daily PA  was not associated with self-reported HFs. However, at the within-person level,  performing more moderate physical activity than usual was associated with more  self-reported HFs in women with lower fitness levels. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate aerobic  exercise decreases objective and subjective HFs 24 hours after exercise; however, in  women with lower fitness levels, more daily moderate PA leads to more self-reported  symptoms.","2012-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1095-1103","","10","19","","Menopause","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22735162  PMCID: PMC3460032","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Self Report; Exercise/*physiology; Accelerometry; Menopause/*physiology; Galvanic Skin Response; Hot Flashes/*physiopathology/psychology; Vasomotor System/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AIM: To investigate how self-reported PLO changed among  home-dwelling people from age 70 to 80 and 85 years. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective,  population-based 15-year follow-up study of the age cohort of 70-year-olds living in  the city of Turku, Finland. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The data were collected in 1991 by  a postal questionnaire that was sent to all residents of Turku, Finland, born in  1920 (N=1530). Follow-ups using the same procedure were conducted in 2001 and 2006.  PLO was assessed with the following items: life satisfaction, feeling needed, having  plans for the future, having zest for life, feeling depressed, and suffering from  loneliness. We created a PLO score from the answers to these questions, where 1  represented the best PLO and 0 the poorest. RESULTS: At baseline, the participants  showed rather high levels of positive life orientation (PLO total score 0.83). PLO  declined markedly after the 70-year-old participants reached the age of 80 and 85  years (p<.001). However, depressive feelings remained quite stable. The decrease was  similar among men and women except for the items suffering from loneliness and  feeling needed. At age 70 and 80 years women suffered more from loneliness than men,  while men experienced feeling needed more than women. CONCLUSIONS: Positive life  orientation declines during old age, especially from age 70 to 80 years.

Baseline characteristics  were used to derive the risk score (RS) to reflect individual's baseline  pre-widowhood vulnerability. Time-dependent Cox regression analyses were used to  estimate spousal loss-related mortality by causes. RESULTS: For males, the adjusted  hazard ratios (aHRs) of widowhood for all-cause and some major causes of death  (e.g., neoplasm) increased inversely with RS: the aHRs for all-cause death were 4.81  and 1.76 in the lowest and highest RS groups, respectively.

We examined whether being licensed to drive is associated  with maintaining spatial movement in older persons initially reporting maximum  spatial mobility. METHODS: From the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 571 nondemented,  community-dwelling older persons were identified with (i) baseline data on driving  status, (ii) baseline report of spatial mobility to the largest life space zone, and  (iii) at least one annual follow-up evaluation. Incident constriction of life space  was the primary outcome of interest. RESULTS: Over an average follow-up of 4.3  years, 303 participants reported incident constriction of life space. In a  proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, having a valid  driver's license at baseline was associated with a decreased hazard of reporting a  life space constriction (hazard ratio = 0.39; 95% confidence interval = 0.29-0.54).  Results were unchanged after controlling for number of vascular risk factors and  vascular diseases, low visual acuity, social isolation, and gait speed. Of  participants reporting incident life space constriction, 188 subsequently reported  reexpansion of spatial mobility to the largest zone of life space. Having a valid  driver's license was associated with a greater likelihood of life space recovery  (hazard ratio = 2.00; 95% confidence interval = 1.27-3.17). CONCLUSION: In older  persons, having a valid driving license was associated with reduced hazard of  reporting life space constriction and a greater likelihood of life space recovery if  incident life space constriction occurred.","2012-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:06:37","","984-989","","9","67","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22546958  PMCID: PMC3436089","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Environment; Aging/*physiology/psychology; Mobility Limitation; Chicago; *Automobile Driving/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology; Accidents, Traffic/prevention & control; Licensure; Spatial Behavior; Accidents, Traffic -- prevention & control; Automobile Driving -- legislation & jurisprudence; Automobile Driving -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, perceived control is not set in stone but rather changes  throughout the life course. The aim of this study was to identify cross-sectional  age differences and longitudinal mean-level changes as well as rank-order changes in  perceived control with respect to gender and education. Furthermore, changes in  income and health were analyzed to explain trajectories of perceived control. In a  large and representative sample of Germans across all of adulthood, 9,484  individuals gave information about their perceived control twice over a period of 6  years. Using locally weighted smoothing (LOESS) curves and latent structural  equation modeling, four main findings were revealed: (a) Perceived control increased  until ages 30-40, then decreased until about age 60, and increased slightly  afterwards. (b) The rank order of individuals in perceived control was relatively  unstable, especially in young adulthood, and reached a plateau at about age 40. (c)  Men perceived that they had more control than did women, but there were no gender  differences in the development of perceived control. (d) Individuals with more  education perceived that they had more control than those with less education, and  there were slight differences in the development of perceived control dependent on  education. Taken together, these findings offer important insights into the  development of perceived control across the life span.","2013-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","353-364","","2","49","","Dev Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22545833","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Reference Values; Germany; Young Adult; Aging/*psychology; *Educational Status; Self Concept; *Sex Characteristics; *Perception; Models, Statistical; Mental Processes/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such cross-sectional studies have important limitations and there  is a scarcity of detailed longitudinal MRI studies with repeated measures obtained  in the same individuals in order to investigate regional gray matter changes during  short periods of time in non-elderly healthy adults. In the present study, 52  healthy young adults aged 18 to 50 years (27 males and 25 females) were followed  with repeated MRI acquisitions over approximately 15 months. Gray matter volumes  were compared between the two times using voxel-based morphometry, with the  prediction that volume changes would be detectable in the frontal lobe, temporal  neocortex and hippocampus. Voxel-wise analyses showed significant (P < 0.05,  family-wise error corrected) relative volume reductions of gray matter in two small  foci located in the right orbitofrontal cortex and left hippocampus. Separate  comparisons for males and females showed bilateral gray matter relative reductions  in the orbitofrontal cortex over time only in males. We conclude that, in  non-elderly healthy adults, subtle gray matter volume alterations are detectable  after short periods of time. This underscores the dynamic nature of gray matter  changes in the brain during adult life, with regional volume reductions being  detectable in brain regions that are relevant to cognitive and emotional processes.","2012-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","516-523","","6","45","","Braz J Med Biol Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22450370  PMCID: PMC3854293","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Linear Models; Young Adult; Aging/*physiology; Organ Size; Neuroimaging/*methods; Brain/*anatomy & histology/physiology; Frontal Lobe/anatomy & histology/physiology; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/physiology; Temporal Lobe/anatomy & histology/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Estimating multilevel logistic models, we  controlled for demographics (age, sex), childhood conditions (SES, health,  cognition), later life risk factors (various dimensions of SES and health  behaviors), as well as social inequality (measured by country-specific Gini  coefficients). There is an independent association of childhood living conditions  with elders' odds of aging well. Higher parental SES, better math and reading  skills, as well as self-reports of good childhood health were positively associated  with successful aging, even if contemporary characteristics were controlled for.  Later life SES and health behaviors exhibited the expected correlations with our  dependent variable. Moreover, lower levels of income inequality were associated with  a greater probability of meeting Rowe and Kahn's successful aging criteria. We  conclude that unfavorable childhood conditions exhibit a harmful influence on  individuals' chances to age well across all European welfare states considered in  this study. Policy interventions should thus aim at improving the conditions for  successful aging throughout the entire life course.","2012-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1418-1425","","9","74","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a frequent topic of study, changes of CBF and CMRO(2) during normal  aging are still controversial, as some authors find decreases of both CBF and  CMRO(2) but increased OEF, while others find no change, and yet other find divergent  changes. In this reanalysis of previously published results from positron emission  tomography of healthy volunteers, we determined CMRO(2) and CBF in 66 healthy  volunteers aged 21 to 81 years. The magnitudes of CMRO(2) and CBF declined in large  parts of the cerebral cortex, including association areas, but the primary motor and  sensory areas were relatively spared. We found significant increases of OEF in  frontal and parietal cortices, excluding primary motor and somatosensory regions,  and in the temporal cortex. Because of the inverse relation between OEF and  capillary oxygen tension, increased OEF can compromise oxygen delivery to neurons,  with possible perturbation of energy turnover. The results establish a possible  mechanism of progression from healthy to unhealthy brain aging, as the regions most  affected by age are the areas that are most vulnerable to neurodegeneration.","2012-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1177-1187","","7","32","","J Cereb Blood Flow Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22373642  PMCID: PMC3390816","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult; Positron-Emission Tomography; Aging/*physiology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Brain/*blood supply/*metabolism/physiopathology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology; Energy Metabolism/*physiology; Oxygen Consumption/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We examined associations of long-term change in  C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with concurrent onset of physical  and cognitive impairment, subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality in  1,051 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study All Stars Study. Biomarkers  were measured in 1996-1997 and 2005-2006. RESULTS: In 2005-2006, median age was 84.9  years, 63% were women and 17% non-white; 21% had at least a doubling in CRP over  time and 23% had at least a doubling in IL-6. Adjusting for demographics, CVD risk  factors, and 1996-1997 CRP level, each doubling in CRP change over 9 years was  associated with higher risk of physical or cognitive impairment (odds ratio 1.29;  95% confidence interval 1.15, 1.45). Results were similar for IL-6 (1.45; 1.20,  1.76). A doubling in IL-6 change over time, but not CRP, was associated with  incident CVD events; hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.34 (1.03, 1.75).  Doubling in change in each biomarker was individually associated with mortality  (CRP: 1.12 [1.03, 1.22]; IL-6 1.39 [1.16, 1.65]). In models containing both change  and 2005-2006 level, only level was associated with CVD events and mortality.  CONCLUSIONS: Although increases in inflammation markers over 9 years were associated  with higher concurrent risk of functional impairment and subsequent CVD events and  mortality, final levels of each biomarker appeared to be more important in  determining risk of subsequent events than change over time.","2012-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:40:34","","970-976","","9","67","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22367431  PMCID: PMC3436091","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Cognition; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Aging -- blood; 9007-41-4; C-Reactive Protein; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-6 -- blood; Inflammation -- physiopathology; Interleukin-6/blood; C-Reactive Protein/metabolism; Aging/blood/*physiology/psychology; Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/mortality/physiopathology/psychology; Inflammation Mediators/blood; Inflammation/blood/*physiopathology; Vermont/epidemiology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- mortality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- physiopathology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- blood; IL6 protein, human; Cardiovascular Diseases -- psychology; Inflammation -- blood; C-Reactive Protein -- metabolism; Inflammation Mediators; Inflammation Mediators -- blood; Vermont -- epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has not been examined longitudinally, and it is uncertain whether the TSH  increase reflects healthy aging or occult thyroid failure. METHODS: We measured  serum TSH, free T(4), thyroid peroxidase, and thyroglobulin antibodies in 1100  participants in the 1981 and 1994 Busselton Health Surveys and derived a reference  group of 908 individuals without thyroid disease or thyroid antibodies. We examined  changes in thyroid function longitudinally and, in 781 participants, explored  associations with the CAPZB polymorphism rs10917469. RESULTS: At 13 yr follow-up,  mean serum TSH increased from 1.49 to 1.81 mU/liter, a change in mean TSH (ΔTSH) of  0.32 mU/liter [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27, 0.38, P < 0.001], whereas mean  free T(4) concentration was unchanged (16.6 vs. 16.6 pmol/liter, P = 0.7). The TSH  increase was most marked in the elderly, such that gender-adjusted ΔTSH increased by  0.08 mU/liter (95% CI 0.04, 0.11) for each decade of baseline age. People with  higher baseline TSH values had proportionally smaller increases in TSH, with each  additional 1.0 mU/liter of baseline TSH associated with a 0.13 mU/liter decrease  (age and gender adjusted) in ΔTSH (95% CI 0.09, 0.16). The ΔTSH did not differ  significantly by CAPZB genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with increased  serum TSH concentrations, with no change in free T(4) concentrations. The largest  TSH increase is in people with the lowest TSH at baseline. This suggests that the  TSH increase arises from age-related alteration in the TSH set point or reduced TSH  bioactivity rather than occult thyroid disease.","2012-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1554-1562","","5","97","","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 22344200","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Age Factors; Health Surveys; Aging/*physiology; Thyrotropin/blood; Thyroxine/blood; Autoantibodies/blood; Iodide Peroxidase/blood; Thyroglobulin/immunology; Thyroid Function Tests; Thyroid Gland/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seventy healthy sedentary subjects  (39 female; 21–77 years) were recruited from the Dallas Heart Study, a  population-based, random community sample and enriched by a second random sample  from employees of Texas Health Resources. Subjects were highly screened for  co-morbidities and stratified into four groups according to age: G(21−34): 21–34  years, G(35−49): 35–49 years, G5(0−64): 50–64 years, G(≥65): ≥65 years. All subjects  underwent invasive haemodynamic measurements with right heart catheterization to  define Starling and left ventricular (LV) pressure–volume curves. LV end-diastolic  volumes (EDV) were measured by echocardiography at baseline, −15 and −30 mmHg  lower-body negative pressure, and 15 and 30 ml kg(−1) saline infusion with  simultaneous measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. There were no  differences in heart rate or blood pressures among the four groups at baseline.  Baseline EDV index was smaller in G(≥65) than other groups. LV diastolic  pressure–volume curves confirmed a substantially greater LV compliance in G(21−34)  compared with G(50−64) and G(≥65), resulting in greater LV volume changes with  preload manipulations. Although LV chamber compliance in G(50−64) and G(≥65)  appeared identical, pressure–volume curves were shifted leftward, toward a decreased  distensibility, with increasing age. These results suggest that LV stiffening in  healthy ageing occurs during the transition between youth and middle-age and becomes  manifest between the ages of 50 to 64. Thereafter, this LV stiffening is followed by  LV volume contraction and remodelling after the age of 65.","2012-04-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:51:10","","1871-1880","","8","590","","J Physiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22331419  PMCID: PMC3573309","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Cohort Studies; Blood Pressure -- physiology; Young Adult; Blood Pressure/physiology; Diastole/physiology; Echocardiography/methods; Aging/*physiology; Stroke Volume/physiology; Cardiac Catheterization/methods; Compliance/physiology; Heart Rate/physiology; Heart/*physiology; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure/physiology; Ventricular Function, Left/physiology; Echocardiography -- methods; Stroke Volume -- physiology; Cardiac Catheterization -- methods; Compliance -- physiology; Diastole -- physiology; Heart -- physiology; Heart Rate -- physiology; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure -- physiology; Ventricular Function, Left -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Outcome variables in this study are collectively referred to as quality of life (QOL). We also examined the mediating role of proactive adaptations between internal and external resources and QOL indicators. Method: Based on five annual interviews of a sample of 1000 community-dwelling older adults in Florida (effective N = 561), we tested the lagged effects of stressors on two indicators of QOL, four years later. In the full longitudinal model, using structural equations, we estimated the direct effects of internal and external resources on QOL, along with indirect effects through proactive adaptations. Results: Stressors negatively influenced QOL four years later. Internal and external resources led to better QOL four years later, both directly and indirectly through proactive adaptations of marshaling support and planning for the future. Conclusion: These findings lend support to the Proactivity Model of Successful Aging by documenting the value of proactive adaptations (i.e., exercise, planning ahead, and marshaling support) as proximate influences on QOL outcomes (i.e., depressive symptomatology and social activities). Findings suggest that older adults can maintain successful aging even in the face of health-related and social stressors by invoking accumulated resources to deal actively with the challenges of aging.","2012","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:13:39","","438-451","","4","16","","Aging Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22299813  PMCID: PMC3825511","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Psychological; Prospective Studies; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Social Support; Self Report; *Quality of Life; Aging/*psychology; Depression; Goals; *Stress, Psychological; Florida; Clinical Assessment Tools; Goodness of Fit Chi Square Test; Interviews; Quality of Life -- In Old Age; Psychological Well-Being -- In Old Age; Adaptation, Psychological -- In Old Age; Maximum Likelihood; Stress, Psychological -- Prevention and Control -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, neural  mechanisms underlying protective effects of these lifestyle behaviors are largely  unknown. In the current study, we investigated the effect of self-reported PA and CA  on hippocampal volume and semantic processing activation during a fame  discrimination task, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We  also examined whether possession of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele could  moderate the effect of PA or CA on hippocampal structure or function. METHODS:  Seventy-eight healthy, cognitively intact older adults underwent baseline  neuropsychological assessment, hippocampal volume measurement via manually-traced  structural MRI, and task-activated fMRI. RESULTS: After 18 months, 27 participants  declined by one standard deviation or more on follow-up neuropsychological testing.  Logistic regression analyses revealed that CA alone or in combination with baseline  hippocampal structure or functional activity did not predict the probability of  cognitive decline. In contrast, PA interacted with APOE 4 status such that  engagement in PA reduced the risk of cognitive decline in APOE 4 carriers only.  Furthermore, the benefits of PA appeared to diminish with reduced functional  activity or volume in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that  increased leisure time PA is associated with reduced probability of cognitive  decline in persons who are at high risk for AD. The beneficial effects of PA in this  group may be related to enhancement of the functional and structural integrity of  the hippocampus.","2012-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","436-446","","4","9","","Curr Alzheimer Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 22272622  PMCID: PMC3584642","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; *Aging; *Life Style; Apolipoproteins E/*genetics; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Motor Activity/physiology; *Cognition Disorders/genetics/pathology/psychology; Hippocampus/blood supply/*pathology; Oxygen/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positive health effects of maintenance of normal weight, routine exercise, and nonsmoking are known for the short and intermediate term. We studied the effects of these risk factors into advanced age.Methods: A cohort of 2327 college alumnae aged 60 years or more was followed annually (1986-2005) by questionnaires addressing health risk factors, history, and Health Assessment Questionnaire disability. Mortality data were ascertained from the National Death Index. Low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were created on the basis of the number (0, 1, ≥2) of health risk factors (overweight, smoking, inactivity) at baseline. Disability and mortality for each group were estimated from unadjusted data and regression analyses. Multivariable survival analyses estimated time to disability or death.Results: The medium- and high-risk groups had higher disability than the low-risk group throughout the study (P<.001). Low-risk subjects had onset of moderate disability delayed 8.3 years compared with high-risk subjects. Mortality rates were higher in the high-risk group (384 vs 247 per 10,000 person-years). Multivariable survival analyses showed the number of risk factors to be associated with cumulative disability and increased mortality.Conclusion: Seniors with fewer behavioral risk factors during middle age have lower disability and improved survival.

The growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis is  involved in muscle function and genetic variants in genes in the axis may influence  measures of physical capability. METHODS: As part of the Healthy Ageing across the  Life Course (HALCyon) programme, men and women from seven UK cohorts aged between 52  and 90 years old were genotyped for six polymorphisms: rs35767 (IGF1), rs7127900  (IGF2), rs2854744 (IGFBP3), rs2943641 (IRS1), rs2665802 (GH1) and the exon-3  deletion of GHR. The polymorphisms have previously been robustly associated with  age-related traits or are potentially functional. Meta-analysis was used to pool  within-study genotypic effects of the associations between the polymorphisms and  four measures of physical capability: grip strength, timed walk or get up and go,  chair rises and standing balance. RESULTS: Few important associations were observed  among the several tests. We found evidence that rs2665802 in GH1 was associated with  inability to balance for 5 s (pooled odds ratio per minor allele = 0.90, 95% CI:  0.82-0.98, p-value = 0.01, n = 10,748), after adjusting for age and sex.

DESIGN: Ordinal  logistic regression modelling was used to interpret risk. Proportional odds  modelling assessed four divisions of ranked CHD risk (4, high; 3, increased; 2,  slight; 1, minimal), separately by sex. SETTING: Baltimore, MD, USA. SUBJECTS:  African-American and white participants (n 1823) from baseline of the Healthy Aging  in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study, aged 30-64 years.  RESULTS: For men, there was a 0·5 % increase in risk for every 10-unit rise in serum  ferritin (pmol/l). Other significant predictors included increased BMI, white race,  unemployment and C-reactive protein ≥9·5 mg/l. For women, there was a 1·5 %  [corrected] increase in risk per 10-unit rise in serum ferritin (pmol/l).

Methods: This was a 2-year prospective study of 476 cognitively healthy community dwellers (aged 60-92 years) recruited in Hong Kong. Participants were assessed with a battery of cognitive tests and questionnaires on their sense of loneliness and leisure activities. Results: A high level of cognitive activity participation (r = 0.13, p = 0.03) and a low level of loneliness (r = -0.15, p = 0.01) were associated with better cognitive test performance. Participants with more years of education (odds ratio = 1.27, p < 0.001) and a higher frequency of drinking (odds ratio = 1.17, p = 0.05) were associated with high cognitive function, while those with a high level of loneliness (odds ratio = 0.79, p = 0.01) were associated with low cognitive function. The correlation with cognitive activity participation remained significant in participants with very good cognitive function (r = 0.20, p = 0.04).

PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand two hundred eighty-six  survey participants aged 61 to 85. MEASUREMENTS: Self-assessed physical and mental  health, quality of life, and cognition constitute the outcome factor: successful  aging. Attributes measuring past and current mental and physical health, social  measures, and health behaviors were considered for inclusion as predictor measures.  Results of the final model allowed calculation of individual weighted successful  aging scores. RESULTS: The final model closely fitted responses from participants  and men and women separately. Factors measuring mental and physical health and  social support contributed significantly and independently to successful aging.  Health behaviors, measuring extent of physical exercise and not smoking, contributed  to successful aging in addition to their association with physical health. On  average, those scoring in the highest decile of the successful aging measure  reported having two chronic health conditions, indicating that such conditions do  not necessarily preclude high levels of well-being in older individuals.

Functional neuroimaging of regions such as the  medial temporal lobe (MTL) have produced conflicting findings. Using functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have recently shown that young healthy  individuals show a stronger activation of the MTL during encoding of objects as  compared with encoding of positions. Using the same encoding task, the present study  addressed the question whether this greater MTL activation during encoding of  objects varies with age. Fifty-four healthy individuals aged between 18 and 81 years  underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and subsequently  made new-old judgments on objects and positions. Region of interest (ROI) analysis  of task related changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was  performed in native space after correction for gender effects and individual  differences in cerebral blood flow. The hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal,  perirhinal, entorhinal, and temporopolar cortices of right and left hemisphere were  defined as ROIs. Aging had an adverse effect on memory performance that was similar  for memorizing objects or positions. In left and right MTL, relatively greater  activation for object stimuli was attenuated in older individuals. Age-related  attenuation in content specificity was most prominent in the recognition stage.  During recognition, the larger response to objects gradually decreased with age in  all ROIs apart from left temporopolar and entorhinal cortex. An age-related  attenuation was also present during encoding, but only in right parahippocampus and  amygdala. Our results suggest that memory-related processing in the MTL becomes  gradually less sensitive to content during normal aging.","2012-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:06:46","","1874-1889","","9","33","","Neurobiol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE: The  aim of the study was to determine associations of testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG  with changes in body composition and physical function. DESIGN AND SETTING: We  conducted a prospective cohort study within the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS)  study at six U.S. clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5994 ambulatory men  aged 65 yr or older enrolled in the MrOS. We examined 1183 men with complete  measures of sex steroid hormones, body composition, and some measure of physical  function. INTERVENTION: There were no interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Sex  steroids were measured by mass spectrometry in serum collected at baseline.  Measurements of body composition using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and physical  performance (grip strength, leg power, timed chair stands, narrow walk, and 6-m  walk) were performed at baseline and repeated 4.5 yr later. RESULTS: Overall, men  lost 1.3 kg (±4.4 sd) weight between study visits. Lean mass, especially  appendicular, declined less at higher baseline testosterone levels (P < 0.05). These  associations were most evident in the 40% of men who lost more than 2.0 kg during  follow-up. In weight losers, higher testosterone was associated with less decline in  timed chair stands. Estradiol was not related to body composition or physical  function changes. Higher SHBG was associated with less loss of appendicular lean  mass and grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: Higher endogenous testosterone is associated  with reduced loss of lean mass and lower extremity function in older men losing  weight.

These include cardiovascular  disease, diabetes, and premature aging. Small clinical studies suggest that  psychological stress may increase oxidative stress. However, confirmation of this  association in epidemiological studies has been limited by homogenous populations  and unmeasured potential confounders. PURPOSE: We tested the cross-sectional  association between self-reported racial discrimination and red blood cell (RBC)  oxidative stress in a biracial, socioeconomically heterogeneous population with  well-measured confounders. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a  consecutive series of 629 participants enrolled in the Healthy Aging in  Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. Conducted by the  National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, HANDLS is a prospective  epidemiological study of a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3,721 Whites and  African Americans aged 30-64 years. Racial discrimination was based on self-report.  RBC oxidative stress was measured by fluorescent heme degradation products.  Potential confounders were age, smoking status, obesity, and C-reactive protein.  RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 49 years (SD = 9.27). In multivariable  linear regression models, racial discrimination was significantly associated with  RBC oxidative stress (Beta = 0.55, P < 0.05) after adjustment for age, smoking,  C-reactive protein level, and obesity. When stratified by race, discrimination was  not associated with RBC oxidative stress in Whites but was associated significantly  for African Americans (Beta = 0.36, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest  that there may be identifiable cellular pathways by which racial discrimination  amplifies cardiovascular and other age-related disease risks.","2012-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","489-495","","4","19","","Int J Behav Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21913047  PMCID: PMC3496810","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Smoking; Self Report; Oxidative Stress/*physiology; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; European Continental Ancestry Group/psychology; *Racism; African Americans/psychology; Erythrocytes/*metabolism; Stress, Psychological/*metabolism/psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is largely unknown whether moderate alcohol intake is also associated with overall health and well-being among populations who have survived to older age. In this study, we prospectively examined alcohol use assessed at midlife in relation to successful ageing in a cohort of US women.Methods and Findings: Alcohol consumption at midlife was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Subsequently, successful ageing was defined in 13,894 Nurses' Health Study participants who survived to age 70 or older, and whose health status was continuously updated. ""Successful ageing"" was considered as being free of 11 major chronic diseases and having no major cognitive impairment, physical impairment, or mental health limitations. Analyses were restricted to the 98.1% of participants who were not heavier drinkers (>45 g/d) at midlife. Of all eligible study participants, 1,491 (10.7%) achieved successful ageing. After multivariable adjustment of potential confounders, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption at midlife was associated with modestly increased odds of successful ageing. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.0 (referent) for nondrinkers, 1.11 (0.96-1.29) for ≤ 5.0 g/d, 1.19 (1.01-1.40) for 5.1-15.0 g/d, 1.28 (1.03-1.58) for 15.1-30.0 g/d, and 1.24 (0.87-1.76) for 30.1-45.0 g/d. Meanwhile, independent of total alcohol intake, participants who drank alcohol at regular patterns throughout the week, rather than on a single occasion, had somewhat better odds of successful ageing; for example, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.29 (1.01-1.64) and 1.47 (1.14-1.90) for those drinking 3-4 days and 5-7 days per week in comparison with nondrinkers, respectively, whereas the odds ratio was 1.10 (0.94-1.30) for those drinking only 1-2 days per week.Conclusions: These data suggest that regular, moderate consumption of alcohol at midlife may be related to a modest increase in overall health status among women who survive to older ages.","2011-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:22:30","","e1001090","","9","8","","PLoS Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21909248  PMCID: PMC3167795","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Health Status; United States; Prospective Studies; Odds Ratio; Aging -- Physiology; *Health Status; United States/epidemiology; Aging/*physiology; Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology; Nurses/*statistics & numerical data; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Alcohol Drinking -- Epidemiology; Nurses -- Statistics and Numerical Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear mixed regression models  showed that all trajectories of body composition with healthy ageing were quadratic.  Fat mass, BMI and percentage of body fat increased from age 20 years and levelled  off at approximately 80 years. Fat-free mass increased slightly from age 20 to 47  years and then declined at a non-linear rate with ageing. Levels of aerobic exercise  had a positive influence on fat mass and a slight negative effect on fat-free mass.

Because dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)  has been associated with several indicators of healthy aging, we conducted a  population-based study of midlife women to determine the relationship between DHEA-S  levels and depressive symptoms and major depression during the transition through  menopause. Unexpectedly, the original report revealed a positive correlation between  DHEA-S levels and depressive symptoms at baseline. The cohort was studied over  11 years to determine whether the positive association between DHEA-S levels and  depression persists through the menopausal transition. We conducted a longitudinal  cohort study with 11 assessments during an 11-year interval in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, using a randomly identified, population-based sample of 436 African  American and Caucasian premenopausal women aged 35 to 47 years at enrollment. For  outcome measures, we used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and  standardized diagnosis of major depression. In a multivariable model, DHEA-S levels  were positively associated with depressive symptoms when adjusted for age,  menopausal stage, race, smoking status, and body mass index. There was no  association between DHEA-S levels and a diagnosis of major depression. DHEA-S levels  were positively associated with depressive symptoms through the menopausal  transition. No association with major depression was apparent during the menopausal  transition, but results may have limited power due to low prevalence of major  depression in this cohort. These findings suggest that taking DHEA supplements may  increase depressive symptoms for some women, and women and their physicians should  be cautious about instituting DHEA replacement therapy during the menopausal  transition.","2011-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:08:11","","375-382","","5","14","","Arch Womens Ment Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21773816  PMCID: PMC3690802","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Adult; Cohort Studies; 57B09Q7FJR; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate -- blood; Menopause/*psychology; Hormone Replacement Therapy/*adverse effects; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/*adverse effects/*blood; Depression/*blood/chemically induced; Depressive Disorder, Major/*blood/chemically induced/diagnosis; Hormone Replacement Therapy -- adverse effects; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate -- adverse effects; Depression -- blood; Depression -- chemically induced; Depressive Disorder, Major -- blood; Depressive Disorder, Major -- chemically induced; Depressive Disorder, Major -- diagnosis; Menopause -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to be  involved in age-related cognitive decline in otherwise healthy individuals. The  gender-specific role of the BDNF gene in cognitive aging remains unclear. The  identification of genetic biomarkers might be a useful approach to identify  individuals at risk of cognitive decline during healthy aging processes. The aim of  this study was to investigate the associations between three single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BDNF gene and domains of cognitive functioning in normal  cognitive aging. The sample, comprising 369 participants (M = 72.7 years,  SD = 4.45 years), completed an extensive neuropsychological test battery measuring  memory, motor function, and perceptual speed. The relationships between the SNPs  rs6265, rs7103411, and rs7124442 and cognitive domains were examined. While  significant main effects of BDNF SNPs on cognitive function were found for the  association between rs7103411 and memory performance, gender-specific analyses  revealed for females significant main effects of rs7103411 for memory and of rs6265  for perceptual speed independent of the APOE*E4 status and education. The finding  for the association between rs6265 and perceptual speed in females remained  significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. None of the  analyses showed significant results for males. This study is the first to implicate  that the SNPs rs6265 and rs7103411 affect cognitive function in the elderly in a  gender-specific way.","2012-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:57:46","","1011-1022","","4","34","","Age (Dordr)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21695421  PMCID: PMC3682062","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Reference Values; Aging -- genetics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Analysis of Variance; Confidence Intervals; Linear Models; Cognition/*physiology; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Cognition Disorders/*genetics/physiopathology; *Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Aging/*genetics/physiology; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics; Cognition Disorders -- physiopathology; Geriatric Assessment -- methods; Cognition Disorders -- genetics; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor -- genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While some of them enjoy a long healthy aging, others develop  neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Environmental factors  are critical, but genetics could explain the differences observed. It has recently  been postulated that longevity genes might also be neuroprotective. OBJECTIVES: To  assess whether certain genetic variants associated with longevity might have a  neuroprotective effect. METHODS: The subjects of this study are people older than 90  years. We will collect sociodemographic and clinical data and multiple assessments,  cognitive, functional, anthropometric, nutritional, sensory and physical each  participant. In addition, 64 SNPs loci distributed in 13 candidate genes FOXO3,  SIRT1, TOMM40, APOE, PICALM, COMT, CETP, CLU, CR1, IL-6, PCK-1, ZNF224 and ACE will  be analysed by Taqman array. RESULTS: It is hoped to gain more knowledge about  under/over-represented alleles in nonagenarians. Furthermore, comparison of the  genetic characteristics of nonagenarians with AD with those free of disease will  enable links to be seen between certain alleles with protection or the risk of AD.  Associated information on the participants will create subgroups showing the  interactions between environment and genetic variation in relation to healthy aging  and AD. CONCLUSION: The study of the genetic variability of nonagenarians can give  us information on the alleles associated with longevity and neuroprotection.","2011-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","217-222","","4","46","","Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol","","","","","","","","spa","Copyright © 2010 SEGG.

It is critical to  address the barriers that disproportionately affect participation in clinical  research by minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. This study sought to  identify and rectify these barriers to recruit and retain a biracial (African  American and non-Hispanic White) and socioeconomically diverse cohort for a  longitudinal study. DESIGN AND METHOD: The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of  Diversity across the Life Span study is a 20-year longitudinal examination of how  race and socioeconomic status influence the development of age-related health  disparities. One goal was to create a multifactorial recruitment and retention  strategy. The recruitment paradigm targeted known barriers and identified those  unique to the study's urban environment. The retention paradigm mirrored the  recruitment plan but was based on specifically developed approaches. RESULTS: This  cohort recruitment required attention to developing community partnerships,  designing the research study to meet the study hypotheses and to provide benefit to  participants, providing a safe community-based site for the research and creating  didactics to develop staff cultural proficiency. These efforts facilitated study  implementation and enhanced recruitment resulting in accrual of a biracial and  socioeconomically diverse cohort of 3,722 participants. IMPLICATIONS: Recruiting and  retaining minority or poor research participants is challenging but possible. The  essential facets include clear communication of the research hypothesis, focus on  providing a direct benefit for participants, and selection of a hypothesis that is  directly relevant to the community studied.","2011-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:07:36","","S33-45","","Suppl 1","51 Suppl 1","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21565817  PMCID: PMC3092978","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Urban Population -- statistics & numerical data; Sampling Studies; Patient Selection; Residence Characteristics; Poverty/*statistics & numerical data; Urban Population/statistics & numerical data; African Americans/*statistics & numerical data; European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data; *Patient Selection; *Patient Dropouts; Cultural Diversity; Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data; Maryland/epidemiology; African Americans -- statistics & numerical data; European Continental Ancestry Group -- statistics & numerical data; Healthcare Disparities -- statistics & numerical data; Maryland -- epidemiology; Patient Dropouts; Poverty -- statistics & numerical data; Community-based research platform; Cultural proficiency; Health disparities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores the dynamic relationship between participation in  social activities and trajectories of depressive symptomatology among older  Taiwanese adults surveyed over 18 years. METHODS: Data are from a nationally  representative sample of 1,388 adults aged 60-64 first surveyed in 1989 and followed  over an 18-year time period for a total of six waves. Individual involvement in  social activities was categorized into continuous participation, ceased  participation before age 70, initiating participation in older adulthood, never  participated, and dropped out before age 70. Two domains of depressive  symptoms--negative affect and lack of positive affect--were measured using a 10-item  version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. RESULTS: Analyses  using growth curve modeling showed that continuously participating or initiating  participation in social activities later life is significantly associated with fewer  depressive symptoms among older Taiwanese adults, even after controlling for the  confounding effects of aging, individual demographic differences, and health status.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maintaining or initiating social  participation in later life benefits the mental health of older adults.

Although report of self-neglect is more common among black older adults,  the racial/ethnic differences in mortality remain unclear. METHODS: The Chicago  Healthy Aging Project is a population-based cohort study conducted from 1993 to  2005. A subset of these participants were suspected to self-neglect and were  reported to a social services agency. Mortality was ascertained during follow-up and  from the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess  the mortality risk. RESULTS: In the total cohort, there were 5,963 black and 3,475  white older adults, and of these, 1,479 were reported for self-neglect (21.7% in  black and 5.3% in white older adults). In multivariable analyses with extensive  adjustments, the interaction term indicated that impact of self-neglect on mortality  was significantly stronger in black than in white older adults (parameter estimate,  0.54, SE, 0.14, p < .001). This difference persisted over time. In  race/ethnicity-stratified analyses, at 6 months after report of self-neglect, the  hazard ratio for black older adults was 5.00 (95% confidence interval, 4.47-5.59)  and for white older adults was 2.75 (95% confidence interval, 2.19-3.44).

Little evidence was found for the opposite direction that functional limitations predict ensuing changes in memory. Spline models indicated that dynamic associations between memory and functional limitations were substantively similar between participants aged 70-79 and those aged 80-95. Potential covariates (gender, education, health conditions, and depressive symptoms) did not account for these differential lead-lag associations.

METHODS: A retrospective case-control audit was performed on 19 patients  aged ≥ 80 years (mean age 85 ± 0.7 year) who underwent a manometric study for  dysphagia (2004-2009). Data were compared with 19 younger dysphagic patients (32 ±  1.7 years). Detailed manometric analysis performed prospectively included basal  lower esophageal sphincter pressure (BLESP), pre-swallow and nadir LESP, esophageal  body pressures and peristaltic duration, during water swallows (5 mL) in right  lateral (RL) and upright (UR) postures and with solids. Data are mean ± SE; a  P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Elderly dysphagic patients had  higher BLESP than younger patients (23.4 ± 3.8 vs 14.9 ± 1.2 mmHg; P < 0.05).  Pre-swallow LESP was elevated in the elderly in both postures (RL: 1 and 4 s P =  0.019 and P = 0.05; UR: P < 0.05 and P = 0.05) and solids (P < 0.01). In older  patients, LES nadir pressure was higher with liquids (RL: 2.3 ± 0.6 mmHg vs 0.7 ±  0.6 mmHg, P < 0.05; UR: 3.5 ± 0.9 mmHg vs 1.6 ± 0.5 mmHg, P = 0.01) with shorter  relaxation after solids (7.9 ± 1.5 s vs 9.7 ± 0.4 s, P = 0.05).

This study aims to quantify the relationship between the  physical activity of a 65-year-old cohort and the level of life satisfaction and  self-rated health 7 years later. METHODS: A total of 988 questionnaires were sent by  mail to a representative sample of healthy pensioners. Life satisfaction and health  status were estimated on two visual analogical scales in answer to the following  questions: (1) How would you estimate your state of health? and (2) Are you  generally satisfied with your life? The level of physical activity was estimated  using a questionnaire which enabled us to calculate: (1) Daily energy expenditure  (DEE), (2) physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), (3) daily energy expenditure  higher than 5 metabolic equivalents (METs) (DEQisa), (4) Activity index (PAEE/DEE),  (5) VO(2) peak. RESULTS: In all, 686 responses were validated. The average age was  72.9 ± 1.2 years old with 59.5% of women (n = 408). Amongst the sample, 98.8%  (n = 676) lived in their own homes and 25.2% (n = 172) lived alone.

This paper explores the  association between an increase in the amount of non-contribution pensions, public  cash transfers given to Costa Rican elderly of low socio-economic status (SES) and  changes in self-rated health over time. The analysis is based on data from CRELES,  the ""Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging"", which is based on a  probabilistic sample of people born in 1945 or earlier, and living in Costa Rica by  2002. The fieldwork for the first and second waves of CRELES was conducted from 2004  to 2006, and from 2006 to 2008, respectively. The Costa Rican Government raised the  amount of the non-contribution pension for the poor 100% before July 2007, and an  additional 100% after that date. Due to the CRELES fieldwork schedule, the data have  a natural quasi-experimental design, given that approximately half of CRELES  respondents were interviewed before July 2007, independently of their status in  receiving the public cash transfers. Using random effects ordered probit regression  models, we find that people who experienced such increase report a greater  improvement in self-rated health between waves than those who experienced a smaller  increase and than the rest of the interviewees. Results suggest that increases in  income may lead to a greater improvement in self-rated health.","2011-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1228-1235","","8","72","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Positive perspectives of ageing are underpinned by a range of appraoches to successful ageing. This study aimed to investigate whether baseline biological, psychological and social aproaches to successful ageing predicted future QoL. Methods: Postal follow-up in 2007/8 of a national random sample of 999 people aged 65 and over in 1999/2000. Of 496 valid addresses of survivors at follow-up, the follow-up response rate was 58% (287). Measures of the different concepts of successful ageing were constructed using baseline indicators. They were assessed for their ability to independently predict quality of life at follow-up. Results: Few respondents achieved all good scores within each of the approaches to successful ageing. Each approach was associated with follow-up QoL when their scores were analysed continuously. The biomedical (health) approach failed to achieve significance when the traditional dichotomous cut-off point for successfully aged (full health), or not (less than full health), was used. In multiple regression analyses of the relative predictive ability of each approach, only the psychological approach (perceived self-efficacy and optimism) retained significance. Conclusion: Only the psychological approach to successful ageing independently predicted QoL at follow-up. Successful ageing is not only about the maintenance of health, but about maximising one's psychological resources, namely self-efficacy and resilience. Increasing use of preventive care, better medical management of morbidity, and changing lifestyles in older people may have beneficial effects on health and longevity, but may not improve their QoL. Adding years to life and life to years may require two distinct and different approaches, one physical and the other psychological. Follow-up health status, number of supporters and social activities, and self-rated active ageing also significantly predicted QoL at follow-up. The longitudinal sample bias towards healthy survivors is likely to underestimate these results.","2011-03-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:12:47","","13","","1","9","","Health Qual Life Outcomes","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21388546  PMCID: PMC3063186","","","","Aged; Humans; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Forecasting; Health Policy; Social Behavior; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Health Surveys; Self Efficacy; United Kingdom; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Aging/physiology/*psychology; *Health Status; Quality of Life/*psychology; Self-Assessment; Forecasting/methods; *Health Policy; Surveys; Great Britain; Regression; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Self Assessment; Self-Efficacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  it remains unclear whether optimism is also correlated to less feelings of  loneliness over time. We aimed to determine whether dispositional optimism is  prospectively associated with less feelings of loneliness, independently of  potential confounders inherent to the aging process. METHODS: We observed 416 older  men aged between 70 and 89 years (mean 74.9 years, standard deviation [SD] 4.7  years) within the population-based Zutphen Elderly Study during 10 years of  follow-up. Baseline dispositional optimism was assessed using a four-item  questionnaire. The presence of feelings of loneliness, the main outcome of our  study, was assessed using the 11-item loneliness scale of De Jong Gierveld in the  years 1990, 1993, 1995, and 2000. The association between baseline dispositional  optimism and loneliness over time was tested by using multilevel regression analysis  and by adjusting for potential confounders (i.e. age, living arrangement, social  contacts, widowhood, memberships, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms).  RESULTS: Feelings of loneliness significantly increased during 10 years of follow-up  but showed temporal stability (reliability coefficient 0.78). Low baseline  dispositional optimism was strongly associated with loneliness over time, also in  the adjusted analysis. A 1 SD increase in baseline dispositional optimism was  associated with a 0.14 SD (95% confidence interval 0.04-0.23) lower level of  loneliness (F(1,320)  = 7.8; p = 0.006).

METHODS: The data are from three cohorts in the HALCyon  collaborative research programme into healthy ageing: Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936  (n = 428), Hertfordshire Ageing Study (n = 358) and Hertfordshire Cohort Study  (n = 3,216). The Mokken scaling model was applied to each sub-scale of SF-36 to  evaluate unidimensionality as indicated by scalability. The lower bound for internal  consistency reliability was determined by Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: All six  sub-scales of SF-36, with the exception of general health (GH) and mental health  (MH), demonstrated strong scalability (0.5 ≤ H < 1). The results were consistent  across all 3 cohorts. Both GH and MH showed medium scalability (0.4 ≤ H <0.55),  although individual items 'sick easier..', 'as healthy as..' and 'expect to get  worse' of the GH sub-scale and 'nervous', 'happy' in the MH sub-scale had low  scalability (H < 0.4) in the oldest cohort (aged 73-83). Cronbach's alphas for all  sub-scales were between 0.70 and 0.92. CONCLUSIONS: The unidimensionality and  reliability of the sub-scales of SF-36 are sufficient to make this a useful measure  of health-related quality of life in older people. Caution is needed when  interpreting the results for GH and MH in the oldest cohort due to the poor  unidimensionality.","2011-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:09:20","","1005-1010","","7","20","","Qual Life Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 21225350  PMCID: PMC3161183","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; *Quality of Life; Scotland; Surveys and Questionnaires/*standards; Health Surveys/*instrumentation; Psychometrics/*instrumentation; Statistics as Topic/methods; Surveys and Questionnaires -- standards; Health Surveys -- instrumentation; Psychometrics -- instrumentation; Statistics as Topic -- methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This raises the possibility that a similar approach applied to  amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) will increase our understanding of its  theoretical and clinical constructs, particularly if functions whose integrity is  heterogeneous with respect to etiological outcome can be found. In this study we  examined visual search performance (the brain's ability to search effectively  throughout the environment for a particular object) in aMCI compared to healthy  aging. Cross-sectionally, visual search performance in aMCI was significantly poorer  than in healthy aging, with greater intra-group performance heterogeneity in the  aMCI compared to the healthy older adult group. This outcome illustrates that  although individuals within an aMCI group ostensibly have the same condition they  can differ substantially with respect to the integrity of aspects of brain function.  Such findings may have implications for the clinical management of the individual  patient. The results from the longitudinal aspect of this study also illustrate how  heterogeneity in the performance of brain operations other than memory in aMCI may  help to inform the likelihood of their developing dementia, as those patients who  were diagnosed with dementia within 2.5 years of baseline measurement showed  significantly poorer visual search performance compared to those who did not.","2011","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","151-160","","1","24","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 21187582","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Visual Perception/*physiology; Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*psychology; Photic Stimulation/*methods; Reaction Time/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on recent conceptual thinking about worry and pain, we explored the  relationship between pain status and worry about health and anxiety in 1217  community-dwelling men aged 70 years or older who participated in the baseline phase  of the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project study, a large population-based  epidemiological study of healthy ageing based in Sydney, Australia. We hypothesised  that worry about health would be associated with having persistent pain, and that  the association would be stronger in the presence of co-existing pain-related  interference with activities (intrusive pain). Of men in the study, 12.5% had  persistent and intrusive pain, 22.4% were worried about their health, and 6.3% had  anxiety. We found a strong association between worry about health and pain that was  both persistent and intrusive, and that remained after accounting for age, number of  comorbidities, depression, self-rated health status, arthritis, and gait speed  (adjusted odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.8-4.7), P<0.0001). The  corresponding adjusted odds ratio for the association between anxiety and pain was  2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.0-4.8; P=0.0363). These findings suggest that at a  population level, subthreshold anxiety and pain are strongly related, and worry  about health occurs much more commonly than anxiety itself. To our knowledge, this  is the first study to explore, specifically, the relationship between pain status  and worry about health in older men. In older community-dwelling men, pain was  robustly associated with worry about health, highlighting the potential importance  of subthreshold anxiety-related psychological factors.","2011-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:46:14","","447-452","","2","152","","Pain","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright Â© 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

We investigated cortical grey matter volume patterns in parietal areas. The grey matter of the somatosensory cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobule was measured in 75 older adults (38 cognitively stable and 37 individuals with cognitive decline after 3years). Dementia screening 6years after scanning resulted in nine AD cases from the cognitively stable (n=3) and cognitive decline group (n=6), who were assigned to a third group, the preclinical AD group. When regional differences in cortical volume in the parietal lobe areas were compared between groups, significant differences were found between either the cognitive decline or stable group on the one hand and preclinical AD individuals on the other hand in the inferior parietal lobule. Group membership was best predicted by the grey matter volume of the inferior parietal lobule, compared to the other parietal lobe areas. The parietal lobe was characterised by a differential atrophy pattern based on cognitive status, which is in agreement with the 'last-developed-first-atrophied' principle. Future studies should investigate the surplus value of the inferior parietal lobe as a potential marker for the diagnosis of AD compared to other brain regions, such as the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal lobe.","2011-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:56:13","","154-163","","2","75","","Brain Cogn","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: In a  cross-sectional study, BMI, waist circumference (WC), body composition by  dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and metabolic risk factors such as TAG, HDL  cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, uric acid and C-reactive  protein were measured. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic  regression analyses were conducted. SETTING: Baltimore, Maryland. SUBJECTS: White  and African-American US adults (n 1981), aged 30-64 years. RESULTS: In predicting  risk of MetS using obesity-independent National Cholesterol Education Program Adult  Treatment Panel III criteria, percentage total body fat mass (TtFM) assessed using  DEXA measuring overall adiposity had no added value over WC. This was true among  both men (area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.680 v. 0.733 for TtFM and WC,  respectively; P < 0.05) and women (AUC = 0.581 v. 0.686). Percentage rib fat mass  (RbFM) was superior to TtFM only in women for MetS (AUC = 0.701 and 0.581 for RbFM  and TtFM, respectively; P < 0.05), particularly among African-American women.  Elevated percentage leg fat mass (LgFM) was protective against MetS among  African-American men. Among white men, BMI was inferior to WC in predicting MetS.  Optimal WC cut-off points varied across ethnic-sex groups and differed from those  recommended by the National Institutes of Health/North American Association for the  Study of Obesity.

Longitudinal studies  on the change of fiber tract integrity in normal and pathological aging are still  rare. Here, we prospectively studied 11 healthy elderly subjects and 14 subjects  with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical risk group for AD, using  high-resolution DTI and MRI at baseline and after 13 to 16 months follow-up.  Fractional anisotropy (FA), a DTI measure of fiber tract integrity, was compared  across time points and groups using a repeated measures linear model and tract based  spatial statistics. Additionally, we determined rates of grey matter and white  matter atrophy using automated deformation based morphometry. Healthy elderly  subjects showed decline of FA in intracortical projecting fiber tracts, such as  corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, inferior  fronto-occipital fasciculus, and cingulate bundle (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple  comparisons). MCI subjects showed significant FA decline predominantly in the  anterior corpus callosum (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Grey and  white matter atrophy involved prefrontal, parietal, and temporal lobe areas in  controls and prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal lobe areas in MCI subjects and  agreed with the pattern of fiber tract changes. Our findings indicate that DTI  allows detection of microstructural changes in subcortical fiber tracts over time  that are related to aging as well as to early stages of AD type neurodegeneration.  The underlying mechanisms for these changes are unknown.","2010","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:39:12","","507-522","","2","22","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 20847446","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Mapping; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Apolipoproteins; Brain -- Pathology; *Aging; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; Brain/*pathology; Anisotropy; Chi-Square Distribution; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*pathology; *Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods; Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics; Cognition Disorders; Middle Age; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Nerve Fibers -- Pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recruited 3722  participants from Baltimore, Md. with a mean age of 47.7 (range 30-64) years, 45%  males; 2200 African Americans (59%) and 1522 whites (41%); 41% reported household  incomes below the 125% poverty delimiter.

The aims of this study were to identify predictors of long-term survival in older women and to develop a multivariable model based upon longitudinal data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF).Methods: We considered only the youngest subjects (n = 4,097) enrolled in the SOF cohort (65 to 69 years of age) and excluded older SOF subjects more likely to exhibit a ""frail"" phenotype. A total of 377 phenotypic measures were screened to determine which were of most value for prediction of long-term (19-year) survival. Prognostic capacity of individual predictors, and combinations of predictors, was evaluated using a cross-validation criterion with prediction accuracy assessed according to time-specific AUC statistics.Results: Visual contrast sensitivity score was among the top 5 individual predictors relative to all 377 variables evaluated (mean AUC = 0.570). A 13-variable model with strong predictive performance was generated using a forward search strategy (mean AUC = 0.673). Variables within this model included a measure of physical function, smoking and diabetes status, self-reported health, contrast sensitivity, and functional status indices reflecting cumulative number of daily living impairments (HR >or= 0.879 or RH <or= 1.131; P < 0.001). We evaluated this model and show that it predicts long-term survival among subjects assigned differing causes of death (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease; P < 0.01). For an average follow-up time of 20 years, output from the model was associated with multiple outcomes among survivors, such as tests of cognitive function, geriatric depression, number of daily living impairments and grip strength (P < 0.03).Conclusions: The multivariate model we developed characterizes a ""healthy aging"" phenotype based upon an integration of measures that together reflect multiple dimensions of an aging adult (65-69 years of age). Age-sensitive components of this model may be of value as biomarkers in human studies that evaluate anti-aging interventions. Our methodology could be applied to data from other longitudinal cohorts to generalize these findings, identify additional predictors of long-term survival, and to further develop the ""healthy aging"" concept.","2010-08-17","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:49:34","","55","","","10","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 20716351  PMCID: PMC2936300","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Human; Aging -- Physiology; *Health Status; Aging/*physiology; Survival Rate/trends; *Survivors; Data Mining/*methods/trends; Osteoporosis/mortality; Data Mining -- methods; Data Mining -- trends; Osteoporosis -- mortality; Survival Rate -- trends; Survivors; Data Mining -- Methods; Data Mining -- Trends; Osteoporosis -- Mortality; Survival -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a debate exists for their upper age limit. The aim of this study is  to examine the outcomes of orthotopic liver transplants from older patients (>or= 60  years). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Organ Procurement and Transplant  Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) data, we retrospectively  analyzed graft and patient survivals of orthotopic liver transplants done with  octogenarian grafts (n=197) and compared them with orthotopic liver transplants done  with donors aged between 60 and 79 years (n=4003) and < 60 years (n=21 290) during  2003 to 2007. RESULTS: One- and 3-year graft and patient survival rates among  recipients of hepatic allografts from donors < 60 years of age were significantly  superior to recipients of octogenarian grafts (graft: 84% vs 75.5% at 1 year; 74.2%  vs 61.2% at 3 years; P < .001; patient: 87.8% vs 81.0% at 1-year; 79.3% vs 69.1% at  3 years; P < .001). However, there was no survival difference between recipients of  allografts from donors aged > 80 years and 60-79 years (graft: 75.5% vs 77.4% at 1  year; 61.2% vs 64.2% at 3 years; P = .564; patient: 81.0% vs 83.8% at 1 year; 69.1%  vs 71.8% at 3 years; P = .494). It correlates well with hepatitis C  virus-seronegativity and relatively lower model for end-stage liver disease score  among recipients of octogenarian grafts (P < .001).

The authors aimed to  determine the risk of CVD incidence and death associated with several  classifications of depression. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted  (1994-2006) in a regionally representative sample of 1000 non-institutionalised  older Australians age 65+ years (47% men). Endpoints were non-fatal CVD incidence  and death over 10 and 12-years, respectively. Depression incidence was assessed at  2-years. Depression related predictors were defined by symptoms (Psychogeriatric  Assessment Scales, depression scale) and/or antidepressants to determine independent  and/or joint effects on endpoints. Cox regressions determined unadjusted and  multiple-adjusted (for significant covariates) hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Baseline  response rate was 70.3%. Aggregate dropout rate was approximately 24% for survivors  at biennial follow-ups, but death status was ascertained for all participants.  Several classifications of depression predicted death in unadjusted analyses (39-60%  >1), but effects disappeared in multiple-adjusted analyses (in which all HRs became  <1 and non-significant). Depression related predictors were thus not associated with  CVD incidence; or death after accounting for confounding mostly by CVD, diabetes and  poor functional health covariates. Prevalent arthritis, respiratory disease and  daily pain were predictors (P < 0.05) of depression incidence. CONCLUSIONS:  Depression related predictors were not independently associated with CVD incidence  or death in older people. Antidepressants were not associated with CVD or premature  death, accounting for whether participants' remained symptomatic or not. Depression  co-occurs with and might be partly caused by chronic disease and poor functional  health.","2011-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:58:58","","341-350","","4","26","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20690128","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Cardiovascular Diseases -- epidemiology; Incidence; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Confidence Intervals; Depression -- epidemiology; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Australia/epidemiology; mortality; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; depression; Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use; Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality/psychology; Depression/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- mortality; Australia -- epidemiology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- psychology; Antidepressive Agents; Antidepressive Agents -- adverse effects; Antidepressive Agents -- therapeutic use; Depression -- drug therapy; Depression -- mortality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Mortality; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Interviews; Data Analysis Software; Antidepressive Agents -- Administration and Dosage; Depression -- Mortality; antidepressant; CVD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is very important to diagnose aMCI for early treatment. In order to investigate biochemical changes in aMCI, we measured metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) from patients with aMCI and compared the results with healthy controls (HCs) and patients with AD. Methods: The subjects were 52 HCs, 70 AD patients and 47 aMCI patients. 1H-MR spectra with single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy at a short echo time (TE) were acquired from 8 volumes of interest in the brain. Results: The bilateral hippocampal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations from aMCI patients showed intermediate values, which were lower than those from HC subjects but higher than those from AD patients. The patients with aMCI also had lower concentrations of NAA than HCs in the bilateral posterior periventricular and deep white matters (PDWM) and posterior cingulate gyrus and had lower levels of choline compounds in the left posterior PDWM. Conclusion: Using a single-voxel 1H-MRS at a short TE, we revealed that absolute quantification is useful to detect the characteristic patterns of metabolite concentrations in patients with aMCI as compared with AD patients and HCs.

To examine whether and how regional variables relate to between-person disparities in the progression of late-life well-being, we applied three-level growth curve models to 24-year longitudinal data from deceased participants of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (N = 3,427; age at death = 18 to 101 years). Results indicated steep declines in well-being with impending death, with some 8% of the between-person differences in both level and decline of well-being reflecting between-county differences. Exploratory analyses revealed that individuals living and dying in less affluent counties reported lower late-life well-being, controlling for key individual predictors, including age at death, gender, education, and household income. The regional variables examined did not directly relate to well-being change but were found to moderate (e.g., amplify) the disparities in change attributed to individual variables. Our results suggest that resource-poor counties provide relatively less fertile grounds for successful aging until the end of life and may serve to exacerbate disparities. We conclude that examinations of how individual and residential characteristics interact can further our understanding of individual psychological outcomes and suggest routes for future inquiry.","2010-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:18:40","","661-676","","3","25","","Psychol Aging","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved.","","","","","","PMID: 20677887  PMCID: PMC2980782","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Social Environment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Personal Satisfaction; Germany; Individuality; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Health Status Disparities; Young Adult; Aging/*psychology; *Personal Satisfaction; Quality of Life/*psychology; Residence Characteristics; *Social Environment; Models, Statistical; Geography; Middle Age; Adolescence; Quality of Life -- Psychosocial Factors; Geographic Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In late 2005 questionnaires were mailed to 866 women aged 51-66 years from rural and urban locations in Queensland, Australia and participating in Stage 2 of the Healthy Aging of Women Study. The questionnaires sought data on socio-demographics, body mass index (BMI), chronic health conditions, self-efficacy, exercise and dietary behavior change since age 40, and health-related quality of life. Five hundred and sixty four (69%) were completed and returned by early 2006. Data analysis comprised descriptive and bivariate statistics and structural equation modeling. The results showed that midlife is a significant time for women to make positive health behavior changes. Approximately one-third of the sample (34.6%) indicated that they had increased their exercise and around 60% had made an effort to eat more healthily since age 40. Modeling showed self-efficacy to be important in making both exercise (βˆ(Z)=0.099;βˆ=0.006;95%CI:0.001,0.011) and dietary (βˆ(Z)=-0.187;βˆ=-0.009;95%CI:-0.013,-0.005) changes. Although education appeared to influence self-efficacy (βˆ(Z)=0.148;βˆ=2.448;95%CI:1.136,3.76) in relation to exercise change, this was not the case for dietary change. The study has application for programs promoting healthy aging among women, and implies that those with low education, high BMI and poor mental health may need considerable support to improve their lifestyles.","2010-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:30:56","","151-158","","2","67","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The function of these systems shows  patterns of circadian rhythmicity and a number of age-related changes in the 24-h  hormonal and non-hormonal rhythms have been found in older human beings. The aim of  this study was to evaluate integration among the nervous, endocrine and immune  systems in the elderly. METHODS: Cortisol and melatonin serum levels were measured  and lymphocyte subpopulation analyses were performed on blood samples collected  every 4 h for 24 h from 15 healthy young-middle-aged subjects (range 36-55 years,  mean age±standard error [SE] 44.08±1.76) and 15 healthy old-aged subjects (range  67-79 years, mean age±SE 68.52±1.27). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant  difference between the groups in the observed values of CD20 (total B cells higher  in young-middle-aged subjects, P=0.02), CD25 (activated T cells with expression of  the α-chain of interleukin-2 receptor, higher in elderly subjects, P=0.04) and DR+ T  cells (activated T cells higher in elderly subjects, P=0.01). There were different  correlations among lymphocyte subpopulations and hormone serum levels in young and  middle-aged subjects in compared to old-aged subjects. In the group of  young-middle-aged subjects, a clear circadian rhythm was validated for the  time-qualified changes of all the factors studied. In the group of elderly subjects,  a clear circadian rhythm was validated for the nyctohemeral changes of CD3 (with a  phase delay of 3 h), CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, CD16, CD25 (in opposite phase), cortisol  (with a phase delay of 1 h) and melatonin. CONCLUSION: The results of the current  study show that aging is associated with enhanced responsiveness of the T-cell  compartment, impairment of B-cell compartment and alterations in temporal  architecture and correlations of neuroendocrine-immune parameters.","2011-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","98-106","","1","11","","Geriatr Gerontol Int","","","","","","","","eng","© 2010 Japan Geriatrics Society.","","","","","","Place: Japan PMID: 20618451","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Reference Values; Aging/*physiology; T-Lymphocytes/*immunology; Adrenal Glands/metabolism; Antigens, CD20/immunology; B-Lymphocytes/*immunology; Hydrocortisone/*blood; Immunity, Cellular/*physiology; Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology; Melatonin/*blood; Neurosecretory Systems/*physiology; Pineal Gland/metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Men  aged ≥55 years were recruited from the community. Morning TT levels were measured on  four occasions in a 12-month period. In all, 96 men aged 62.7 ± 6.8 years were  studied. Geometric mean values (95% confidence interval) of TT levels for the cohort  at each time point were 14.5 (13.4-15.7), 14.6 (13.5-15.8), 15.5 (14.4-16.8) and  15.0 (13.9-16.2) nmol/L. The maximum intra-individual difference in TT between the  four samples was 4.1 nmol/L (interquartile range: 2.9-6.4). Using the average of two  baseline TT values reduces the maximum difference to 2.3 nmol/L (1.0-3.8). Only 1 of  25 men with a documented TT <10 nmol/L at baseline had TT levels <10 nmol/L at all  subsequent time points. A single TT level is a reliable predictor of repeat measures  taken within a 12-month period for a cohort of healthy ageing men with symptoms of  androgen deficiency. However, given that the diagnostic criteria for androgen  deficiency are, in part, predicated upon serum TT, there is sufficient intra-subject  variability to warrant repeat sampling to confirm an initial low TT level. Using an  average of two baseline TT values reduces this variability.","2011-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:22:35","","212-216","","3","34","","Int J Androl","","","","","","","","eng","© 2010 The Authors.

Therefore, the objective of  this study was to compare self-reported health status and functional capacity of  subjects with early OA of hip and/or knee to reference data of healthy working  subjects and to assess whether this capacity is sufficient to meet physical job  demands. METHODS: Self-reported health status and functional capacity of 93 subjects  from the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) were measured using the Short-Form 36  Health Survey and 6 tests of the Work Well Systems Functional Capacity Evaluation.  Results were compared with reference data from 275 healthy workers, using t-tests.  To compare the functional capacity with job demands, the proportions of subjects  with OA performing lower than the p(5) of reference data were calculated. RESULTS:  Compared to healthy workers, the subjects (mean age 56) from CHECK at baseline  reported a significantly worse physical health status, whereas the women (n = 78)  also reported a worse mental health status. On the FCE female OA subjects performed  significantly lower than their healthy working counterparts on all 6 tests. Male OA  subjects performed lower than male workers on 3 tests. A substantial proportion of  women demonstrated functional capacities that could be considered insufficient to  perform jobs with low physical demands.

While the concept of ""successful aging""  has been popular for many decades, little is known about its psycho-physiologic and  endocrine underpinnings. KORA-Age is a population-based, longitudinal study designed  to determine the prevalence of successfully aged men and women between 65 and 94  years old in the MONICA/KORA Augsburg cohort of randomly selected inhabitants.  Specifically, we aim to identify predictors of successful aging and to elucidate  bio-psychosocial mechanisms that maintain mental health and successful adaptation  despite adverse experiences of life and aging. METHODS/DESIGN: Components of  successful aging were assessed in a telephone survey of 4,127 participants  (2008-2009) enrolled in the MONICA/KORA cohort, on average, 13 years earlier.  Psychosocial, somatic and behavioural predictors are used to determine factors that  contribute to successful aging. An age-stratified random sub-sample (n = 1,079)  participated in a personal interview where further psychological mechanisms that may  underlie successful adaptation (resilience, social support, attachment) were  examined. The interactions among neuroendocrine systems in the aging process are  investigated by studying the cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate ratio, the  level of insulin-like growth factor I, and oxytocin. DISCUSSION: Longitudinal  determinants of successful aging can be assessed based on a follow-up of an average  of 13 years. A comprehensive analysis of biological as well as physio-psychological  information provides a unique opportunity to investigate relevant outcomes such as  resilience and frailty in the elderly population.","2010-04-30","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:34:28","","36","","","10","","BMC Med Res Methodol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 20433701  PMCID: PMC2876177","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Mental Health; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Social Support; Hormones; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Geriatric Assessment; Aging/physiology/*psychology; *Mental Health; Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; Hormones/physiology; Hormones -- physiology; Support, Psychosocial; Cardiovascular System Physiology; Hormones -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current centenarian cohort in Belfast survived the 1970s epidemic  of death from coronary heart disease in Northern Ireland, where cardiovascular  mortality was almost highest in the world. These centenarians provided an  opportunity to assess biological and genetic factors important in cardiovascular  risk and ageing. METHODS: Thirty-five (27 female, 8 male) centenarians, participants  of the Belfast Elderly Longitudinal Free-living Ageing STudy (BELFAST), were  community-living and of good cognition at enrollment. RESULTS: Centenarians showed  median Body Mass Index (BMI) at 25.7, systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg and diastolic  blood pressure 90 mmHg respectively, and fasting glucose of 5.54 mmol/l with no  sex-related difference. Lipoproteins showed median cholesterol 5.3, High Density  Lipoprotein (HDL) 1.10 and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) 3.47 micromol/l  respectively. Centenarian smokers showed no different blood pressure or lipid  measurements compared with non-smokers. Malondialdehyde, a measure of lipid  peroxidation, was low at 1.19, and measures of antioxidant status showed variable  results. Male centenarians did not carry any of the vascular risk genotypes  studied-Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) and  Methylenetetrafolatedehydrogenase reductase (MTFHR), though this was not true for  female centenarians. CONCLUSIONS: This small local study shows, apart from age, that  Belfast centenarians carry a reasonably optimized risk profile with respect to  cardiovascular disease. There is also some evidence suggesting that vascular risk  factors and genotypes may be tolerated differently between the male and female  centenarians. Maintaining an optimized cardiovascular risk profile seems likely to  improve the chance of becoming a centenarian, especially for males.","2010","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","789-795","","7","16","","Curr Pharm Des","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United Arab Emirates PMID: 20388089","","","","Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Longitudinal Studies; Longevity; Risk Assessment; Blood Pressure; *Geriatric Assessment; Phenotype; Cause of Death; Apolipoproteins E/genetics; Blood Glucose/analysis; *Aged, 80 and over; Antioxidants/metabolism; Cholesterol, LDL/blood; Coronary Disease/*epidemiology/genetics/metabolism; Lipoproteins/metabolism; Malondialdehyde/metabolism; Northern Ireland; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solving the min-cut/max-flow problem on this graph yields  the segmentation for all timepoints in a single step. By segmenting all timepoints  simultaneously, a consistent and atrophy-sensitive segmentation is obtained. The  application to hippocampal atrophy measurement in 568 image pairs (Baseline and  Month 12 follow-up) as well as 362 image triplets (Baseline, Month 12, and Month 24)  from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) confirms previous  findings for atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging. Highly  significant correlations between hippocampal atrophy and clinical variables (Mini  Mental State Examination, MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR) were found and  atrophy rates differ significantly according to subjects' ApoE genotype. Based on  one year atrophy rates, a correct classification rate of 82% between AD and control  subjects is achieved. Subjects that converted from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)  to AD after the period for which atrophy was measured (i.e., after the first 12  months) and subjects for whom conversion is yet to be identified were discriminated  with a rate of 64%, a promising result with a view to clinical application. Power  analysis shows that 67 and 206 subjects are needed for the AD and MCI groups  respectively to detect a 25% change in volume loss with 80% power and 5%  significance.","2010-08-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","109-118","","1","52","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to identify socioeconomic,  health and lifestyle factors in entry to residential aged care facilities. DESIGN: a  prospective cohort study was conducted from 1994 to 2005. SETTING: the information  source was the Melbourne Longitudinal Studies on Healthy Ageing Program. SUBJECTS:  one thousand Australians aged 65 years and over living in the community were used as  baseline sample. METHODS: socio-medical data were gathered in face-to-face baseline  interviews, and outcomes were identified in biennial follow-ups with respondents,  informants and death registries over 12 years. Cox regression models identified  baseline predictors of subsequent entry to residential aged care for men and women  from among socio-demographic, health status and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: the most  significant factors were older age, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)  dependence, cognitive impairment, underweight body mass index (BMI) and low social  activity. For men only, the number of medical conditions and healthy nutrition score  also emerged as significant. For women only, never having been married, IADL  dependence and low BMI also were significant. For men, the risk of entry to  residential aged care facilities was associated mainly with disease burden, whereas  for women, social vulnerability and functional capacities were more important.  Healthy lifestyles were important indirectly insofar as they influenced subjects'  health status. CONCLUSION: to facilitate older people to stay in the community, it  is important to treat or ameliorate medical conditions, promote healthy lifestyles  and consider gender-specific risks.","2010-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","342-349","","3","39","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20233734","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Australia; *Health Status; *Life Style; Residence Characteristics; Homes for the Aged/*statistics & numerical data; Residential Facilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known about its structure in non-clinical samples of older people.Methods: We used data from four cohorts in the HALCyon collaborative research program into healthy aging: the Caerphilly Prospective Study, the Hertfordshire Ageing Study, the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921. We used exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis with multi-group comparisons to establish the structure of the HADS and test for factorial invariance between samples.Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed a bi-dimensional structure (anxiety and depression) of the scale in men and women in each cohort. We tested a hypothesized three-factor model but high correlations between two of the factors made a two-factor model more psychologically plausible. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the sizes of the respective item loadings on the two factors were effectively identical in men and women from the same cohort. There was more variation between cohorts, particularly those from different parts of the U.K. and in whom the HADS was administered differently. Differences in social-class distribution accounted for part of this variation.Conclusions: Scoring the HADS as two subscales of anxiety and depression is appropriate in non-clinical populations of older men and women. However, there were differences between cohorts in the way that individual items were linked with the constructs of anxiety and depression, perhaps due to differences in sociocultural factors and/or in the administration of the scale.","2010-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:28:35","","559-571","","4","22","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 20214846","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; Psychological Tests; Program Development; Human; *Health Status; Psychometrics; *Surveys and Questionnaires; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data; *Program Development; Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology; Community Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data; Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*psychology; Anxiety Disorders -- epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders -- psychology; Depressive Disorder -- epidemiology; Depressive Disorder -- psychology; Anxiety Disorders -- diagnosis; Community Mental Health Services -- statistics & numerical data; Depressive Disorder -- diagnosis; Hospitalization -- statistics & numerical data; Questionnaires; Depression -- Diagnosis; Factor Analysis; Depression -- Epidemiology; Depression -- Psychosocial Factors; Hospitalization -- Statistics and Numerical Data; Anxiety Disorders -- Epidemiology; Anxiety Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Anxiety Disorders -- Diagnosis; Community Mental Health Services -- Utilization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to physical health, less is known about the affect of diet quality on  symptoms of depression. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the relationship between  diet quality and reported symptoms of depression in a low-income urban population.  SUBJECTS/SETTING: Subjects included 1,118 African-American and white adults, aged 30  to 64 years, living in Baltimore, MD, and represented a subsample of the initial  examination and recruitment phase of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity  across the Life Span study. METHODS: Nutrition data were based on two 24-hour  dietary recalls collected by trained interviewers using the US Department of  Agriculture Automated Multiple Pass Method. Diet quality was calculated using the US  Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005. Depressive symptoms were  assessed by a trained interviewer using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies  Depression scale. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Both linear and logistic regression analyses  were used to examine whether or not diet quality was associated with depressive  symptoms. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms and independent variables  included HEI-2005, race, sex, age, education, income, and food-assistance program  participation. RESULTS: Mean HEI-2005 score was 52.17+/-0.40 (out of 100). Mean  Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale score was 11.64+/-0.25 (out of  40). Diet quality was significantly associated with reported symptoms of depression.  However, income was a significantly stronger predictor of depression compared to  diet quality, education, and sex.

We examined the distribution of scores on several cognitive screening tests by age and educational levels in a population-based cohort. Method: An age-stratified random sample of individuals aged 65+ years was drawn from the electoral rolls of an urban US community. Those obtaining age and education-corrected scores >=21/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were designated as cognitively normal or only mildly impaired, and underwent a full assessment including a battery of neuropsychological tests. Participants were also rated on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The distribution of neuropsychological test scores within demographic strata, among those receiving a CDR of 0 (no dementia), are reported here as cognitive test norms. After combining individual test scores into cognitive domain composite scores, multiple linear regression models were used to examine associations of cognitive test performance with age and education. Results: In this cognitively normal sample of older adults, younger age and higher education were associated with better performance in all cognitive domains. Age and education together explained 22% of the variation of memory, and less of executive function, language, attention, and visuospatial function. Conclusion: Older age and lesser education are differentially associated with worse neuropsychological test performance in cognitively normal older adult representatives of the community at large. The distribution of scores in these participants can serve as population-based norms for these tests, and can be especially useful to clinicians and researchers assessing older adults outside specialty clinic settings.

Cross-sectional  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest thinning of the cerebral cortex,  volumetric reductions of most subcortical structures, and ventricular expansion.  However, there is a paucity of detailed longitudinal studies to support the  cross-sectional findings. In the present study, 142 healthy elderly participants  (60-91 years of age) were followed with repeated MRI, and were compared with 122  patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Volume changes were  measured across the entire cortex and in 48 regions of interest. Cortical reductions  in the healthy elderly were extensive after only 1 year, especially evident in  temporal and prefrontal cortices, where annual decline was approximately 0.5%. All  subcortical and ventricular regions except caudate nucleus and the fourth ventricle  changed significantly over 1 year. Some of the atrophy occurred in areas vulnerable  to AD, while other changes were observed in areas less characteristic of the disease  in early stages. This suggests that the changes are not primarily driven by  degenerative processes associated with AD, although it is likely that preclinical  changes associated with AD are superposed on changes due to normal aging in some  subjects, especially in the temporal lobes. Finally, atrophy was found to accelerate  with increasing age, and this was especially prominent in areas vulnerable to AD.  Thus, it is possible that the accelerating atrophy with increasing age is due to  preclinical AD.","2009-12-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","15223-15231","","48","29","","J Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19955375  PMCID: PMC2827793","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Time Factors; Brain Mapping; Alzheimer Disease/pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Aging/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; Atrophy/pathology; Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such studies seek  families that are exceptionally long lived, they also need living members who can  provide DNA and phenotype information. On the basis of these considerations, the  authors developed a metric to rank families for selection into a family study of  longevity. Their measure, the family longevity selection score (FLoSS), is the sum  of 2 components: 1) an estimated family longevity score built from birth-, gender-,  and nation-specific cohort survival probabilities and 2) a bonus for older living  siblings. The authors examined properties of FLoSS-based family rankings by using  data from 3 ongoing studies: the New England Centenarian Study, the Framingham Heart  Study, and screenees for the Long Life Family Study. FLoSS-based selection yields  families with exceptional longevity, satisfactory sibship sizes and numbers of  living siblings, and high ages. Parameters in the FLoSS formula can be tailored for  studies of specific populations or age ranges or with different conditions. The  first component of the FLoSS also provides a conceptually sound survival measure to  characterize exceptional longevity in individuals or families in various types of  studies and correlates well with later-observed longevity.","2009-12-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:15:25","","1555-1562","","12","170","","Am J Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19910380  PMCID: PMC2800272","","","","Aged; Humans; Sex Factors; Cohort Studies; Longevity; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Comparative Studies; Phenotype; *Longevity; Psychometrics; Family Characteristics; *Family; Siblings; Biophysical Instruments; Correlational Studies; Instrument Construction; New England; Prospective Studies -- New England; Sampling Methods; Secondary Analysis; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Survival Analysis -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To model the cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer  disease. DESIGN: Longitudinal archival study comparing individuals who became  demented during follow-up and people who remained nondemented on each of 4 cognitive  factors: global, verbal memory, visuospatial, and working memory. SETTING: Alzheimer  Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis,  Missouri. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-four individuals who became demented  during follow-up and 310 who remained nondemented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inflection  point in longitudinal cognitive performance. RESULTS: The best-fitting model for  each of the 4 factors in the stable group was linear, with a very slight downward  trend on all but the Visuospatial factor. In contrast, a piecewise model with  accelerated slope after a sharp inflection point provided the best fit for the group  that progressed. The optimal inflection point for all 4 factors was prior to  diagnosis of dementia: Global, 2 years; Verbal and Working Memory, 1 year; and  Visuospatial, 3 years. These results were also obtained when data were limited to  the subset (n = 44) with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS: There is  a sharp inflection point followed by accelerating decline in multiple domains of  cognition, not just memory, in the preclinical period in Alzheimer disease when  there is insufficient cognitive decline to warrant clinical diagnosis using  conventional criteria. Early change was seen in tests of visuospatial ability, most  of which were speeded.

Cardiovascular imaging","","1942-0080 1941-9651","10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.108.826602","","BACKGROUND: The left atrium is a validated marker of clinical and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Left atrial enlargement is often seen among older  individuals; however, there are few population-based data regarding normal left  atrial size among older persons, especially from those who are healthy, and from  women. Furthermore, because the left atrium is a 3D structure, the commonly used  parasternal long-axis diastolic diameter often underdiagnoses left atrial  enlargement. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated left atrial size in 230 healthy  participants (mean age, 76+/-5 years) free of prevalent cardiac disease, rhythm  abnormality, hypertension, and diabetes selected from the Cardiovascular Health  Study, a prospective community-based study of risk factors for cardiovascular  disease in 5888 elderly participants. In addition to the standard long-axis  measurement, we obtained left atrial superoinferior and lateral diameters and used  these dimensions to estimate left atrial volume. These measurements were used to  generate reference ranges for determining left atrial enlargement in older men and  women, based on the 95% percentiles of the left atrial dimensions in healthy  participants, both unadjusted, and after adjustment for age, height, and weight. In  healthy elderly subjects, indices of left atrial size do not correlate with age or  height but with weight and other measures of body build. CONCLUSIONS: These data  provide normative reference values for left atrial size in healthy older women and  men. The results should be useful for refining diagnostic criteria for left atrial  dilation in the older population and may be relevant for cardiovascular risk  stratification.","2009-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","282-289","","4","2","","Circ Cardiovasc Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19808608  PMCID: PMC4156514","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Reference Values; United States; Prospective Studies; Models, Biological; Age Factors; Population Surveillance; *Aging; Linear Models; Heart Atria/diagnostic imaging; Organ Size; *Atrial Function, Left; Body Size; Body Surface Area; Echocardiography, Three-Dimensional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors' aimed to determine  the risk of diabetes incidence associated with baseline depression exposures  (symptoms and/or ADM use). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a  regionally representative sample of non-institutionalised older Australian people (N  = 1000, aged 65 + year), who were followed up biennially between 1994 and 2004  (attrition was approximately 24%). Analyses excluded participants for prevalent  diabetes at baseline, determined by self-report or specific medications. Diabetes  incidence was ascertained by first self-report at any follow-up wave. Depression  exposures (baseline predictors) were defined by the Psychogeriatric Assessment  Scales (PAS) depression scale and ADM use, and classified as: (1) 'symptomatic' (PAS  score 5+); (2) 'ADM use'; (3) 'symptomatic or ADM use'; (4) 'symptomatic and no ADM  use'; (5) 'asymptomatic (PAS score <5) and ADM use' and (6) 'symptomatic and ADM  use'. Covariates were demographic, lifestyle, functional health and chronic disease  factors. Cox regressions were used to determined hazard ratios with 95% confidence  intervals (HR [95% CI]) for diabetes incidence according to depression exposures,  adjusted for significant covariates. RESULTS: Baseline response rate was 70.3%.  Depression predictors of diabetes incidence were 'symptomatic' (2.29 [1.28,4.10]),  'symptomatic or ADM use' (2.13 [1.32,3.44]) and 'symptomatic and no ADM use' (2.38  [1.28,4.45]), after adjustment for significant covariates. Being asymptomatic was  not a protective factor among those prescribed antidepressants. CONCLUSIONS: Older  people with depressive symptoms are at least twice more likely to develop diabetes  than those without depressive symptoms, regardless of antidepressants.","2010-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:41:24","","688-696","","7","25","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 19806604","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Cohort Studies; Prevalence; Incidence; Prospective Studies; Australia; Confidence Intervals; Depression -- psychology; Depression -- epidemiology; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Univariate Statistics; Australia/epidemiology; diabetes; elderly; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; depression; Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use; Depression/drug therapy/*epidemiology/psychology; Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/psychology; Geriatric Psychiatry; Diabetes Mellitus -- epidemiology; Australia -- epidemiology; Antidepressive Agents; Antidepressive Agents -- adverse effects; Antidepressive Agents -- therapeutic use; Depression -- drug therapy; Diabetes Mellitus -- psychology; Questionnaires; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Interviews; Data Analysis Software; Relative Risk; OARS Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire; Antidepressive Agents -- Adverse Effects; Depression -- Complications; Diabetes Mellitus -- Risk Factors; antidepressants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to identify an age-related  network pattern of MRI gray matter using a multivariate statistical model of  regional covariance, the Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) with voxel based morphometry  (VBM) in 29 healthy adults, 23-84 years of age (Group 1). In addition, we evaluated  the reproducibility of the age-related gray matter pattern derived from a prior SSM  VBM study of 26 healthy adults, 22-77 years of age (Group 2; Alexander et al., 2006)  in relation to the current sample and tested the ability of the network analysis to  extract an age-related pattern from both cohorts combined. The SSM VBM analysis of  Group 1 identified a regional pattern of gray matter atrophy associated with healthy  aging (R(2)=0.64, p<0.000001) that included extensive reductions in bilateral  dorsolateral and medial frontal, anterior cingulate, insula/perisylvian, precuneus,  parietotemporal, and caudate regions with areas of relative preservation in  bilateral cerebellum, thalamus, putamen, mid cingulate, and temporal pole regions.  The age-related SSM VBM gray matter pattern, previously reported for Group 2, was  highly expressed in Group 1 (R(2)=0.52, p<0.00002). SSM analysis of the combined  cohorts extracted a common age-related pattern of gray matter showing reductions  involving bilateral medial frontal, insula/perisylvian, anterior cingulate and, to a  lesser extent, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral temporal, parietal, and  caudate brain regions with relative preservation in bilateral cerebellum, temporal  pole, and right thalamic regions. The results suggest that healthy aging is  associated with a regionally distributed pattern of gray matter atrophy that has  reproducible regional features. Whereas the network patterns of atrophy included  parietal, temporal, and subcortical regions, involvement of the frontal brain  regions showed the most consistently extensive and reliable reductions across  samples. Network analysis with SSM VBM can help detect reproducible age-related MRI  patterns, assisting efforts in the study of healthy and pathological aging.","2010-01-15","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:31","","1750-1759","","2","49","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19796692  PMCID: PMC2789892","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- pathology; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Brain -- pathology; Neuropsychological Tests; Apolipoprotein E4; Regression Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Young Adult; Aging/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; Organ Size; Apolipoprotein E4/genetics; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated/*pathology; Neural Pathways/pathology; Apolipoprotein E4 -- genetics; Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated -- pathology; Neural Pathways -- pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reliance upon vision  places older adults at risk for falls because they are often not aware of the  magnitude of their body motion. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was  to determine the influence of stationary anchors and vection upon egomotion in  young, young-old and old adult age groups using the moving room paradigm. METHODS:  Forty-five healthy participants separated into 3 age groups (young, 18-20 years;  young-old, 60-69 years; old, 70-79 years) were tested. Participants stood on a force  platform in front of an oscillating virtual moving room. Optical flow fields were  presented to the central and peripheral areas of the retina, individually and  jointly. Postural motion was assessed through center of pressure (COP). There were 5  room conditions used to evaluate the role of central and peripheral vision upon  postural motion. Participants rated their vection, perceived amount of motion, and  the magnitude of the visual scene motion following each condition. RESULTS: In all  optical flow conditions, old adults produced more postural motion than the young and  young-old adults. Participants were quite accurate at rating their postural motion  and vection with their COP displacement; however, young adults rated their vection  higher, yet produced significantly less COP displacement than the older adults.  Postural responses were also decreased in both age groups when portions of the  visual scene were occluded in central or peripheral vision. These findings indicate  visual sensitivity to visual scene motion as a function of age when information is  available to all areas of the retina. Static images in the visual scene provide a  reference point which was found to assist in the stabilization of body position,  decreasing fall risk. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults exhibited increased egomotion, yet  decreased vection in response to visual scene motion. It is likely that the  reduction in proprioceptive feedback due to healthy aging induces greater COP motion  in the older adults before they perceive visual scene motion, placing them at an  increased risk for incurring falls.","2009","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","637-643","","6","55","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland PMID: 19707011","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Prospective Studies; Accidental Falls; Young Adult; Aging/*physiology; Postural Balance/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Photic Stimulation; Motor Activity/*physiology; Motion Perception/physiology; Orientation/*physiology; Proprioception/*physiology; User-Computer Interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this conclusion is based on earlier  studies whose findings may be influenced by the inclusion of subjects with  subclinical cognitive disorders like preclinical dementia. The present magnetic  resonance imaging study tested this hypothesis. Cognitively healthy subjects (mean  age 72 years, range 52-82) who remained cognitively stable over a 3-year period were  compared to subjects with significant cognitive decline. Subjects who developed  dementia within 6 years after the scan session were excluded. The gray matter  volumes of seven cortical regions were delineated on T1-weighted magnetic resonance  imaging scans. Participants without cognitive decline did not exhibit an age effect  on the gray matter volume. Conversely, participants with cognitive decline exhibited  a significant age effect in all the seven areas. These results suggest that cortical  gray matter atrophy may have been overestimated in studies on healthy aging, since  most studies were unable to exclude participants with a substantial atypical  cognitive decline or preclinical dementia.

However, whether centenarians represent healthy aging still remains an open  question. Previous studies have been hampered by a number of methodological  shortcomings such as a cross-sectional design and lack of an appropriate control  group. In a longitudinal population-based cohort, it was examined whether the  centenarian phenotype may be a useful model for healthy aging. The study was based  on a complete follow up of 39,945 individuals alive in the Danish 1905 birth cohort  on January 1, 1977 identified through the Danish Civil Registration System (DCRS).  Data from the Danish Demographic Database and The Danish National Patient Register  (in existence since 1977) were used. The 1905 cohort was followed up from 1977  through 2004 with respect to hospitalizations and number of hospital days. Survival  status was available until December 2006. Danish centenarians from the 1905 cohort  were hospitalized substantially less than their shorter-lived contemporaries at the  same point in time during the years 1977 through 2004. For example, at age 71-74,  the proportion of nonhospitalized centenarians was 80.5% compared with 68.4% among  individuals who died in their early 80s. This trend was evident in both sexes. As a  result of their lower hospitalization rates and length of stay in hospital compared  with their contemporaries, who died at younger ages, Danish centenarians represent  healthy agers. Centenarians constitute a useful study population in the search for  fixed traits associated with exceptional longevity, such as genotype.","2009-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:59:39","","270-276","","3","8","","Aging Cell","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19627266  PMCID: PMC2774420","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Models, Biological; Life Expectancy; *Aging; healthy aging; *Longevity; centenarians; Denmark; Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data; Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data; exceptional longevity; fixed traits; hospitalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested for obesity interactions with gender, race, and smoking status and conducted stratified analyses based on the results of interaction testing.Results: There was no association between all-cause mortality and BMI or waist circumference in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses. In contrast, all-cause mortality increased with WHR. There was an interaction with sex, so that there was a graded relationship between WHR and mortality in women (relative hazard, 1.28 per 0.1 increase in WHR; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.55) and a threshold relationship in men (relative hazard 1.75 for WHR>1.0 compared to WHR< or =1.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.91).Conclusion: WHR rather than BMI appears to be the more appropriate yardstick for risk stratification of high-functioning older adults.","2009-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:19:27","","724-731","","10","19","","Ann Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19596204  PMCID: PMC3154008","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; United States; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Confidence Intervals; Smoking; Human; *Mortality; Proportional Hazards Models; United States/epidemiology; *Waist-Hip Ratio; Smoking/adverse effects; Waist-Hip Ratio; Obesity/mortality; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Obesity -- Mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a group, younger stroke survivors have less physical impairment and lower  mortality after stroke compared with older survivors; however, the psychosocial and  economic consequences are potentially substantial. Most of these younger stroke  survivors have responsibility for generating an income or providing family care and  indicate that their primary objective is to return to work. However, effective  vocational rehabilitation strategies to increase the proportion of younger stroke  survivors able to return to work, and information on the key target areas for those  strategies, are currently lacking. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-centre, three year  cohort study will recruit a representative sample of younger (< 65 years) stroke  survivors to determine the modifiable predictors of subsequent return to work.  Participants will be recruited from the New South Wales Stroke Services (SSNSW)  network, the only well established and cohesively operating and managed, network of  acute stroke units in Australia.

However, few studies have investigated the impact of sarcopenic/obesity  on physical capacity in older individuals using objective measures of physical  capacity and body composition. This study included 904 older individuals aged  between 68 and 82 years old. Body composition (fat mass (FM) and lean body mass  (LBM) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)), physical capacity (timed up and  go, chair stands, walking speed at normal and fastest pace, and one leg stand), sum  of reported chronic conditions and physical activity level were measured. A global  physical capacity score was then calculated giving a maximal score of 20. Finally,  four groups were created within genders based on sarcopenia and obesity ((i)  nonsarcopenic/nonobese; (ii) sarcopenic/nonobese; (iii) nonsarcopenic/obese; (iv)  sarcopenic/obese). The four groups were significantly different for the sit-to-stand  test and the one leg stand test (P < 0.05) and only for the one leg stand test in  women (P < 0.05). In both genders results for the global physical capacity score  revealed that both obese groups (sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic) were similar (P =  0.14 in men and P = 0.19 in women) and had a lower global physical capacity score  compared to nonsarcopenic/nonobese individuals (P < 0.05). In addition, sarcopenic  women displayed a higher score than both obese nonsarcopenic and obese sarcopenic  groups (P < 0.01). Sarcopenic/obese men and women do not display lower physical  capacity compared to nonsarcopenic/obese individuals in this cohort of  well-functioning older men and women.

The current study examined the hypothesis that  stress may impact health by promoting immunesenescence. Participants were 537  factory workers (89% male; mean age 44; range 18-65years). Blood was analyzed for  two components of the aging 'immune risk phenotype': the number and proportion of  late-differentiated (CD27-CD28-) CD8 T cells (CTLs) and CD4:CD8 ratio. Psychological  assessment focussed on work-related stressors which have previously been found to  predict morbidity and mortality. This assessment included measures of work load,  effort-reward imbalance, and social support at work. High levels of job stress (low  reward, high effort-reward imbalance) and low social support at work were associated  with a significantly lower CD4:CD8 ratio. Also, the number of CD27-CD28- CTLs was  30% to 50% higher in employees classified in the highest tertile of each stress  parameter as compared to employees in the corresponding lowest tertile (p<.01).  These associations withstood adjustment for a wide range of demographic, life style,  medical, and socio-economic indicators. The associations between CTL phenotype and  low social support became stronger with increasing age. These results suggest that  psychosocial stress may contribute to immunological aging.

Methods. Data from the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging study: 8,000 elderly Costa Ricans to determine mortality in the period 2000-2007 and a subsample of 3,000 to determine prevalence of several health conditions and biomarkers from anthropometry and blood and urine specimens. Results. The ultimate health indicator, mortality, as well as the metabolic syndrome, reveals that better educated and wealthier individuals are worse off. In contrast, quality of life-related measures such as functional and cognitive disabilities, physical frailty, and depression all clearly worsen with lower SES. Overall self-reported health (SRH) also shows a strong positive SES gradient. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and cholesterol are not significantly related to SES, but hypertension and obesity are worse among high-SES individuals. Reflecting mixed SES gradients in behaviors, smoking and lack of exercise are more common among low SES, but high calorie diets are more common among high SES. conclusions. Negative modern behaviors among high-SES groups may be reversing cardiovascular risks across SES groups, hence reversing mortality risks. But negative SES gradients in healthy years of life persist.","2009-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:47:44","","105-117","","1","64","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 19196695  PMCID: PMC2654981","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Health Status Disparities; Blood Pressure/physiology; Disability Evaluation; Survival Analysis; *Socioeconomic Factors; Costa Rica; Biomarkers/*blood; Triglycerides/blood; *Health Status Indicators; Cholesterol/blood; Waist-Hip Ratio; Cardiovascular Diseases/*ethnology/*mortality; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/ethnology/mortality; Hispanic Americans/*statistics & numerical data; Hypertension/ethnology/mortality; Metabolic Syndrome/ethnology/mortality; Obesity/ethnology/mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  longitudinal, population based study with a followup of 6.5 years was done in 1,688  men who were 50 to 78 years old. Data were collected on transrectal ultrasound of  prostate volume, urinary flow rate, ultrasound estimated post-void residual urine  volume, generic and disease specific quality of life, and symptom severity based on  the International Prostate Symptom Score. Lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of  benign prostatic hyperplasia were defined as an International Prostate Symptom Score  of greater than 7 after a report of a score of less than 7 in the previous round. A  multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was constructed to determine risk factors  for clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia after correcting for patient age. RESULTS:  Total followup was 4,353 person-years. During followup 180 events of attaining an  International Prostate Symptoms Score of greater than 7 occurred. Multivariate  analysis showed that functional bladder capacity, post-void residual urine volume,  treatment for cardiac diseases, education level, antidepressant use, calcium  antagonist use, erectile function or dysfunction, prostate specific antigen and a  family history of prostate cancer were determinants with a significant HR.  CONCLUSIONS: In addition to age, we established 9 significant determinants for lower  urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, not all  risk factors for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic  hyperplasia are accounted for since we can conclude that 1 of 3 men without these  risk factors will still be diagnosed with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of  benign prostatic hyperplasia between ages 50 and 80 years.","2009-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:02:58","","710-716","","2","181","","J Urol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19091352","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Reference Values; Incidence; Risk Assessment; Analysis of Variance; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Prostatic Hyperplasia -- epidemiology; Probability; Proportional Hazards Models; Diagnosis, Differential; Aging/physiology; Severity of Illness Index; Age Distribution; Prostatic Hyperplasia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology; Ultrasound, High-Intensity Focused, Transrectal; Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Urination Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Urodynamics; Prostatic Hyperplasia -- diagnosis; Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction -- diagnosis; Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction -- epidemiology; Urination Disorders -- diagnosis; Urination Disorders -- epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to determine whether hormonal pathways  potentially involved in energy homeostasis contribute to survival beyond 100 years  of age. METHODS: We assessed a total of 252 centenarians (mean [standard deviation  (SD)] age, 101.5 (1.8) years, range 100-108 years) using a complete set of  biomarkers of adipose endocrine function and the insulin-like growth factor-1  (IGF-1) axis. Conventional risk factors at baseline were also assessed. The  participants were followed up for all-cause mortality every 12 months by telephone  contact. RESULTS: During 2253 days of follow-up, 208 centenarians (82.5%) died. The  lowest tertile of leptin and the highest tertile of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were  associated with higher mortality risk among centenarians after adjusting for age  (per 6-month increase), sex, education, smoking, activities of daily living (ADL),  cognitive function, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR] 1.6; 95% confidence  interval [CI], 1.14-2.35; and HR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00-2.08, respectively). The lowest  tertiles of both IGF-1 and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) were also associated with  increased mortality. The adipose risk score, indicating cumulative effects of  adipokine dysregulation, was strongly associated with increased mortality risk; ADL;  cognitive function; and levels of albumin, cholinesterase, high-density  lipoprotein-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and IGF-1 at baseline.

However, as we are beginning to understand more about this important  phenotype, another demographic group of even more elite survivors is  emerging-so-called ""supercentenarians"" or those who survive 110-plus years. Little  is known about these exceptional survivors. METHODS: We assessed the Okinawa  Centenarian Study (OCS) database for all information on supercentenarians. The  database includes dates of birth and year of death for all residents of Okinawa 99  years old or older and a yearly geriatric assessment of all centenarians who  consented, enabling prospective study of age-related traits. Of 20 potential  supercentenarians identified, 15 had agreed to participate in the OCS interview,  physical examination, and blood draw. Of these 15, 12 (3 men and 9 women) met our  age validation criteria and were accepted as supercentenarians. Phenotypic variables  studied include medical and social history, activities of daily living (ADLs), and  clinical phenotypes (physiology, hematology, biochemistry, and immunology). RESULTS:  Age at death ranged from 110 to 112 years. The majority of supercentenarians had  minimal clinically apparent disease until late in life, with cataracts (42%) and  fractures (33%) being common and coronary heart disease (8%), stroke (8%), cancer  (0%), and diabetes (0%) rare or not evident on clinical examination. Functionally,  most supercentenarians were independent in ADLs at age 100 years, and few were  institutionalized before the age of 105 years. Most had normal clinical parameters  at age 100 years, but by age 105 exhibited multiple clinical markers of frailty  coincident with a rapid ADL decline. CONCLUSION: Supercentenarians displayed an  exceptionally healthy aging phenotype where clinically apparent major chronic  diseases and disabilities were markedly delayed, often beyond age 100. They had  little clinical history of cardiovascular disease and reported no history of cancer  or diabetes. This phenotype is consistent with a more elite phenotype than has been  observed in prior studies of centenarians. The genetic and environmental antecedents  of this exceptionally healthy aging phenotype deserve further study.","2008-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:43:17","","1201-1208","","11","63","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 19038835","","","","Humans; Female; Male; Physical Examination; Health Status; Japan; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Aged, 80 and over/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical performance (PP) was defined as the summary score of 4 tests of physical capacity [Standing Balance, Walking Speed, Chair Stands, and Timed ""Up &Go""]. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and nutritional risk by the Elderly Nutrition Screening (ENS(c)) tool.Results: Prevalence of mild depression (GDS score >or=11 and <or= 20) was 12% in women and 7.6% in men (p = 0.002). Higher PP was observed among subjects without nutritional risk or mild depression (mean score: 10.45 +/- 3.45) as compared to those with both risk factors (8.66 +/- 3.59; p < 0.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, both depressive symptoms and nutritional risk scores were independently associated with PP score after adjustment for age, sex, educational level, income, burden of disease, body mass index and physical activity. There was no interaction of nutritional risk and depressive symptoms in relation to PP. The overall adjusted multiple regression model explained 34% of the observed variance in physical performance score.Conclusions: Nutritional risk and depressive symptoms are both potentially modifiable independent correlates of PP but there is no synergistic effect of the two risk factors.","2008-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:53:30","","492-498","","4","27","","J Am Coll Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18978169","","","","Aged; Humans; Physical Fitness; Female; Male; Nutritional Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; *Depression; Canada; *Motor Activity; Aging/*physiology/psychology; *Nutritional Status; Depression; *Physical Fitness; Quebec; Motor Activity; Questionnaires; Geriatric Depression Scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, successful aging remains ill defined, and its appropriate measurement  is hotly contested. Most studies have focused on the absence of disability or  deficits in physical performance as outcomes. The present study extends this  research by using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3), a multidimensional  measure of health status, to examine the maintenance of exceptionally good health  among older participants in the Canadian National Population Health Survey  (1994--2004). METHODS: The maintenance of exceptionally good health in old age was  examined prospectively among 2432 individuals (65-85 years old at baseline) who met  the inclusion criteria. The participants were classified into one of four health  trajectories: thrivers (who maintained exceptional health with no or only mild  disability), nonthrivers (who experienced a moderate or severe disability), the  deceased, and the institutionalized. RESULTS: In 10 years of follow-up, 190 (8%)  were thrivers (HUI3 score > or = 0.89 at all interviews), 1076 (47%) were  nonthrivers, 893 (36%) died, and 273 (9%) were institutionalized. The maintenance of  exceptionally good health among the elderly participants was related to younger age  at baseline, socioeconomic status (higher income), psychosocial factors (including  lower psychological distress), and behavioral factors (never smoked and moderate  alcohol use). CONCLUSIONS: The maintenance of exceptionally good health in old age  is related, at least in part, to modifiable lifestyle factors.

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Nationwide sample.  PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred forty centenarian offspring and 192 referent cohort  subjects who met inclusion criteria of having initial and follow-up health  questionnaire data available. Median age of both cohorts was 72 at the initial  health questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: Initial health questionnaires were collected  from 1997 to 2006. Follow-up questionnaires were collected from 2004 to 2007. The  mean period of follow-up was 3.5+/-1.7 years for the centenarian offspring and  3.9+/-2.2 years for the referent cohort. RESULTS: During the follow-up period,  centenarian offspring had a 78% lower risk of myocardial infarction (P<.04), 83%  lower risk of stroke (P<.004), and 86% lower risk of developing diabetes mellitus  (P<.005) than the referent cohort. There were no significant differences in new  onset of other age-related diseases. Additionally, centenarian offspring were 81%  less likely to die (P<.01) than the referent cohort during the follow-up.

These findings reinforce the notion that there may be physiological reasons that  longevity runs in families and that centenarian offspring are more likely to age in  better cardiovascular health and with a lower mortality than their peers.","2008-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:59:23","","2089-2092","","11","56","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 18811609  PMCID: PMC2892731","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Morbidity; United States; Incidence; Longevity; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Age Factors; Health Surveys; Case-Control Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Longevity/*genetics; Diabetes Mellitus; Stroke; Chronic Disease/*epidemiology; Adult Children; Questionnaires; Multiple Logistic Regression; Data Analysis Software; Multiple Linear Regression; Fisher's Exact Test; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Epidemiology -- United States; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Correlation Coefficient; Health Status -- Evaluation; Myocardial Infarction; OARS Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using five conceptual models, we test two hypotheses with respect to range of  outcomes among older schizophrenia outpatients and how they compare to their age  peers in the community. We operationalized five outcome measures from the following  conceptual models: Remission, adapting criteria of Andreasen et al. (The American  Journal of Psychiatry, 162:441-449, 2005); Recovery, adapting the criteria by  Liberman et al. (International Review of Psychiatry, 14:256-272, 2002); Community  Integration using the model of Wong and Solomon (Mental Health Services Research,  4:13-28, 2002); Subjective and Objective Successful Aging using the model of Rowe  and Kahn (Science, 237:143-149, 1987). The schizophrenia (S) group consisted of 198  community-dwelling persons aged 55 and over who developed schizophrenia before age  45 and a community comparison (CC) group (N = 113). Remission and recovery criteria  were met by 49 and 17% of the S group, respectively. There were significant  differences between the S and CC groups in the distribution of community integration  and successful aging scales: 41% of the CC group met at least 10 of 12 criteria  versus 23% of the S group on the Community Integration Scale; 19% of the CC group  met all six criteria vs. 2% of the S group on the Objective Successful Aging Scale;  27% of the CC group vs. 13% of the S group met all six criteria on the Subjective  Successful Aging Scale. Correlations among the five outcome measures ranged from r =  .19 to .48 (median value: r = .26 or 7% shared variance). There is wide variability  in outcome in later life depending on which measure is used. Rather than one  universal indicator, each measure offers a different perspective that can provide  useful guidelines for researchers, clinicians, and policy makers.","2009-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","151-156","","2","45","","Community Ment Health J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18787951","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Models, Psychological; Age Factors; Prognosis; Treatment Outcome; Aging/*psychology; Age of Onset; *Schizophrenia; Peer Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined a biomarker of aging based on repeated measures of BMD for up to 15 yr and  hypothesized that maintenance of BMD will be associated with low fracture risk and  disability and improved survival. We studied 9704 women recruited at four U.S.  clinical centers and enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a longitudinal  cohort study. Of these, 8224 women had at least one hip BMD measurement. Hip BMD was  measured a maximum of five times over 15 yr. Random effects regression was used to  determine a BMD slope for each subject. Three groups were formed-""maintained"" BMD:  slope >or=0, n = 724 (9%); ""expected"" BMD loss: slope <0 to <1 SD below mean, n =  6478 (79%); and ""accelerated"" BMD loss: slope >or=1 SD below mean, n = 1022 (12%).  Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the relative hazard (RH; 95%  CI) of fracture, incident mobility disability, and mortality in the maintained and  accelerated groups compared with the expected. A 1 SD decrease in the BMD slope was  associated with an increased risk of all outcomes. In multivariate models, the RH of  nonspine fracture was 0.81 (0.71-0.93) and of hip fracture was 0.36 (0.25-0.53) for  women in the maintained compared with the expected group. The incidence of mobility  disability was lower in the maintained versus expected group (RH = 0.70; 95% CI =  0.59-0.83), but this was largely explained by other factors. Women who experienced  accelerated bone loss were more likely to develop disability (RH = 1.56; 95% CI:  1.33-1.84). Mortality risks were lower in the maintained compared with the expected  group (RH = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.58). In conclusion, a subset of older women  maintained their BMD up to 15 yr, suggesting that bone loss is not an inevitable  consequence of aging. These women experienced a lower risk of fractures, disability,  and mortality, suggesting that this phenotype may be a marker of successful aging.","2009-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:48:06","","134-143","","1","24","","J Bone Miner Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 18715137  PMCID: PMC2605163","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Aging; Cohort Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Bone Density; Regression Analysis; Multivariate Analysis; *Aging; Treatment Outcome; Bone and Bones/*pathology; Fractures, Bone/*pathology; Osteoporosis/*diagnosis/*pathology; Bone and Bones -- pathology; Fractures, Bone -- pathology; Osteoporosis -- diagnosis; Osteoporosis -- pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These changes are often only subtle  when considered over time intervals of several months. Therefore morphometrical  techniques for their detection in longitudinally acquired MR images must be highly  sensitive, and they require a careful validation. In the present study, a novel  processing chain for a longitudinal analysis based on deformation field morphometry  is described. Procedures for its quantitative validation are also reported:  Deformation fields were computed for the simulation of non-linear, local structural  changes of human brains. Applying these deformation fields to ""original"" MR images  yielded deformed MR images. The volume changes defined by the deformation fields  represented the standard, against which the results of the longitudinal analysis of  each pair of original and deformed MR image were compared. The proposed processing  chain enabled to localize and to quantify simulated local atrophies near the cortex  as well as in deep brain structures. An exemplary analysis of serial MR images of a  patient suffering from an atypical Parkinson syndrome (cortico-basal degeneration,  CBD) and healthy control subjects is presented, showing a characteristic pattern of  volume changes in the brain of the patient which is strikingly different from the  controls' patterns of changes.","2008-11-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","269-287","","2","43","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18706506","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Reproducibility of Results; Brain/*pathology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods; *Algorithms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; *Subtraction Technique; Image Enhancement/methods; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we obtained  relative increases in the whole patient sample compared to controls (i.e. areas  relatively preserved in patients) with proportional scaling to the cerebral global  mean (CGM). Next, average absolute counts within the cluster with the highest  t-value were extracted. Statistical comparisons of controls versus three patients  groups were then performed using count normalization to CGM, sensorimotor cortex  (SMC) as standard, and to the cluster-derived counts. Compared to controls, relative  metabolism in aMCI patients was reduced by 15%, 20%, and 23% after normalization to  CGM, SMC, and cluster-derived counts, respectively, and 11%, 21%, and 25% in mild AD  patients. Logistic regression analyses based on normalized values extracted from  AD-typical regions showed that the metabolic values obtained using CGM, SMC, and  cluster normalization correctly classified 81%, 89% and 92% of aMCI and controls;  classification accuracies for AD groups (very mild and mild) were 91%, 97%, and  100%. The proposed algorithm of fully SPM-based count normalization allows for a  substantial increase of statistical power in detecting very early AD-associated  hypometabolism, and very high accuracy in discriminating mild AD and aMCI from  healthy aging.","2009-01-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","43-50","","1","44","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18691659","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Algorithms; Retrospective Studies; Aging/*pathology; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnostic imaging; Brain/*diagnostic imaging; Brain Mapping/*methods; Cognition Disorders/*diagnostic imaging; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Radionuclide Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To test these hypotheses, we prospectively examined  individuals with documented CMBs at 1.5 and 3.0 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five  hundred fifty elderly individuals, who participated in an interdisciplinary study of  healthy aging, were examined at 3.0 T using T2* MRI sequences (repetition time  [TR]/echo time [TE]/flip angle [FA] = 573 ms/16 ms/18 degrees ). Individuals  positive for CMBs were asked to undergo an additional examination at 1.5 T (TR/TE/FA  = 663 ms/23 ms/18 degrees ). Images were analyzed independently by two observers.  CMBs were counted throughout the brain and were qualitatively analyzed comparing the  degree of visible hypointensity on a 5-point scale from 1 (complete signal loss) to  5 (no detection) for both field strengths. Contrast-to-noise ratio of CMBs to  surrounding brain tissue was calculated. RESULTS: At 3.0 T, CMBs were detected in 45  of 550 individuals; 25 agreed to an additional examination at 1.5 T. In this group  (n = 25), a total of 53 CMBs were detected at 3.0 T, compared to 41 CMBs at 1.5 T.  The mean contrast-to-noise ratio of CMBs was significantly increased at 3.0 T  compared to 1.5 T (27.4 +/- 8.2 vs. 17.4 +/- 8.0; p < .001). On qualitative  analysis, visibility of CMBs was ranked significantly higher at 3.0 T (1.3 +/- 0.4  vs. 2.9 +/- 1.1; p < .001). CONCLUSION: Evidence of past microbleeds may even be  found in neurologically normal elderly individuals by MRI. Detection rate and  visibility of CMBs benefit from the higher field strength, resulting in a  significantly improved depiction of iron-containing brain structures (CMBs) at 3.0 T  with potential clinical relevance.","2008-07","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","895-900","","7","15","","Acad Radiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18572126","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods; Statistics, Nonparametric; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Cerebral Hemorrhage/*diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the assessment and correlates of  resilience in elderly individuals have not received adequate attention. METHOD: A  total of 1395 community-dwelling women over age 60 who were participants at the San  Diego Clinical Center of the Women's Health Initiative completed the Connor-Davidson  Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), along with other scales pertinent to successful  cognitive aging. Internal consistency and predictors of the CD-RISC were examined,  as well as the consistency of its factor structure with published reports. RESULTS:  The mean age of the cohort was 73 (7.2) years and 14% were Hispanic, 76% were  non-Hispanic white, and nearly all had completed a high school education (98%). The  mean total score on the CD-RISC was 75.7 (sd=13.0). This scale showed high internal  consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.92). Exploratory factor analysis yielded four  factors (somewhat different from those previously reported among younger adults)  that reflected items involving: (1) personal control and goal orientation, (2)  adaptation and tolerance for negative affect, (3) leadership and trust in instincts,  and (4) spiritual coping. The strongest predictors of CD-RISC scores in this study  were higher emotional well-being, optimism, self-rated successful aging, social  engagement, and fewer cognitive complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the  CD-RISC is an internally consistent scale for assessing resilience among older  women, and that greater resilience as assessed by the CD-RISC related positively to  key components of successful aging.","2008-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:36:15","","148-154","","2","43","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 18455190  PMCID: PMC2613196","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Female; Social Environment; Aged, 80 and over; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Motor Activity -- physiology; Internal-External Control; Social Behavior; Activities of Daily Living; Predictive Value of Tests; Cognition/physiology; Resilience, Psychological; Aging/*psychology; California; *Resilience, Psychological; Psychometrics/methods; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Goals; Motor Activity/physiology; Attitude; Adaptation, Psychological/physiology; Housing for the Elderly/*classification; Leadership; Psychometrics -- methods; Adaptation, Psychological -- physiology; Housing for the Elderly -- classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined reading activity to investigate  the relationship of a solitary, nonstrenuous activity on aging and mortality.  METHODS: A cohort of visually and cognitively intact community-dwelling participants  born in 1920-1921, taken from the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study, underwent  comprehensive assessment at ages 70 and 78. We collected mortality data spanning 8  years. We dichotomized reading frequency to daily or less and performed data  analyses separately by gender. RESULTS: Reading daily was common at both ages 70  (62% of the sample) and 78 (68%) and was associated at baseline with female gender,  Western origin, higher socioeconomic and educational statuses, employment, and  reduced medications. The hazard ratio for mortality over the 8-year follow-up among  men was significantly reduced (hazard ratio = 0.44, 95% confidence interval =  0.23-0.84) after we adjusted for numerous social, medical, and health parameters.  DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that leisure activities devoid of social or  physical benefits may nonetheless contribute to improved aging, predicting reduced  mortality among men. A broader definition of leisure activities may be useful when  considering the impact of these activities among older people.","2008-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:08:10","","S73-80","","2","63","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18441272","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; *Longevity; *Residence Characteristics; Residence Characteristics; *Reading; Reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Decreased nutrition is the final common pathway for DDD and the status of the  endplate (EP) plays a crucial role in controlling the extent of diffusion, which is  the only source of nutrition. The vascular channels in the subchondral plate have  muscarinic receptors but the possibility of enhancing diffusion pharmacologically by  dilation of these vessels has not been probed. Although it is well accepted that EP  damage will affect diffusion and thereby nutrition, there is no described method to  quantify the extent of EP damage. Precise definitions with an objective method of  differentiating healthy, ageing and degenerated discs on the basis of anatomical  integrity of the disc and physiological basis of altered nutrition will be useful.  This information is an urgent necessity for better understanding of DDD and also  strategizing prevention and treatment. Seven hundred and thirty endplates of 365  lumbar discs from 73 individuals (26 healthy volunteers and 47 patients) with age  ranging from 10-64 years were evaluated by pre-contrast and 10 min, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h  post contrast MRI after IV injection of 0.3 mmol/kg of Gadodiamide. End plates were  classified according to the extent of damage into six grades and an incremental  score was given for each category. A total endplate score (TEPS) was derived by  adding the EP score of the two endplates for each concerned disc. The base line  value (SI(base)) and the signal intensity at particular time periods were used to  derive the enhancement percentage for each time period (Enhancement (%) = SI(tp) -  SI(base)/SI(base) x 100). The enhancement percentage for each time period, the time  for peak enhancement (T-max) and the time intensity curve (TIC) over 12 h were used  to study and compare the diffusion characteristics. The differences in pattern of  diffusion were obvious visually at 4 h which was categorized into five  patterns-Pattern A representing normal diffusion to Pattern E representing a total  abnormality in diffusion. Degeneration was classified according to Pfirrmann's  grading and this was correlated to the TEPS and the alterations in diffusion  patterns. The relationship of TEPS on the increase in DDD was evaluated by a  logistic curve and the cut point for severe DDD was found by ROC curve. The  influence of the variables of age, level, Modic changes, instability, annulus  fibrosis defect (DEBIT), TEPS and diffusion patterns on DDD was analyzed by multiple  and stepwise regression analysis. Oral nimodipine study: Additional forty lumbar  end-plates from four young healthy volunteers were studied to document the effect of  oral nimodipine. Pre-drug diffusion levels were studied by pre and post contrast MRI  (0.3 mmol/kg of gadodiamide) at 10 min, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h. Oral nimodipine was  administered (30 mg QID) for 5 days and post-contrast MRI studies were performed  similarly. Enhancement was calculated at vertebral body-VB; subchondral bone-SCB;  Endplate Zone-EPZ and at superior and inferior peripheral nucleus pulposus-PNP and  central nucleus pulposus-CNP, using appropriate cursors by a blinded investigator.  Paired sample t test and area under curve (AUC) measurements were done.The incidence  of disc degeneration had a significant correlation with increasing TEPS (Trend  Chi-square, P < 0.01). Only one out of 83 (1.2%) disc had either Pfirrmann Grade IV  or V when the score was 4 or below when compared to 34/190 (17.9%) for scores 5-7;  41 of 72 (56.9%) for scores 8-10 and 18 of 20 (90%) for scores 11 and 12 (P < 0.001  for all groups). Pearson's correlation between TEPS and DDD was statistically  significant, irrespective of the level of disc or different age groups (r value was  above 0.6 and P < 0.01 for all age groups). Logistic curve fit analysis and ROC  curve analysis showed that the incidence of DDD increased abruptly when the TEPS  crossed six. With a progressive increase of end plate damage, five different  patterns of diffusion were visualized. Pattern D and E represented totally altered  diffusion pattern questioning the application of biological method of treatment in  such situations. Four types of time intensity curves (TIC) were noted which helped  to differentiate between healthy, aged and degenerated discs. Multiple and stepwise  regression analysis indicated that pattern of disc diffusion and TEPS to be the most  significant factors influencing DDD, irrespective of age. Nimodipine increased the  average signal intensity for all regions-by 7.6% for VB, 8% for SCB and EPZ and 11%  for CNP at all time intervals (P < 0.01 for all cases). Although the increase was  high at all time intervals, the maximum increase was at 2 h for VB, SCB and EPZ; 4 h  for PNP and 12 h for CNP. It was also interesting that post-nimodipine, the peak  signal intensity was attained early, was higher and maintained longer compared to  pre-nimodipine values. Our study has helped to establish that EP damage as a crucial  event leading to structural failure thereby precipitating DDD. An EP damage score  has been devised which had a good correlation to DDD and discs with a score of six  and above can be considered 'at risk' for severe DDD. New data on disc diffusion  patterns were obtained which may help to differentiate healthy, ageing and  degenerated discs in in-vivo conditions. This is also the first study to document an  increase in diffusion of human lumbar discs by oral nimodipine and poses interesting  possibility of pharmacological enhancement of lumbar disc nutrition.","2008-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","626-643","","5","17","","Eur Spine J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 18357472  PMCID: PMC2367412","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Child; Contrast Media; Aging/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology; Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology/therapeutic use; Diffusion/drug effects; Gadolinium DTPA; Intervertebral Disc Displacement/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology; Intervertebral Disc/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology; Lumbar Vertebrae/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology; Nimodipine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is widely  acknowledged that the promotion of healthy ageing by delaying, minimizing or  preventing disabilities or diseases is one of the most important public health  objectives in this century. In contrast to the menopausal transition in females, we  know relatively little about the contribution of androgens and anabolic hormones to  the quality of ageing in men. The European Male Ageing Study (EMAS) is a multicentre  prospective cohort designed to examine the prevalence, incidence and geographical  distribution of gender-specific and general symptoms of ageing in men, including  their endocrine, genetic and psychosocial predictors. Men aged 40-79 years were  recruited from eight European centres: Florence (Italy), Leuven (Belgium), Lodz  (Poland), Malmö (Sweden), Manchester (UK), Santiago de Compostela (Spain), Szeged  (Hungary) and Tartu (Estonia). Subjects were recruited from population registers and  those who agreed to take part completed a detailed questionnaire including aspects  of personal and medical history, lifestyle factors and sexual function. Objective  measures of body size, cognition, vision, skeletal health and neuromuscular function  were obtained. Blood and DNA specimens were collected for a range of biochemical and  genetic analyses. After an average of 4 years, it is planned to resurvey the  participants with similar assessments. A total of 3369 men with a mean age of 60 +/-  11 years were recruited. The mean centre response rate was 43%, and highest in those  aged 50-59 years. Those who participated were marginally younger than those who were  invited but declined to participate (60.0 vs. 61.1 years). Participants left  education slightly later than a sample of non-participants, though there were no  consistent differences in levels of general health, physical activity, or smoking.  EMAS will provide new population-based data concerning the main features that  characterize ageing in men and its critical determinants, particularly with  reference to age-related changes in hormone levels. Such information is an important  prerequisite to develop effective strategies to reduce age-related disabilities and  optimise health and well-being into old-age.","2009-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:39:12","","11-24","","1","32","","Int J Androl","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 18328041","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Male; Adult; Diet Records; Europe; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Cohort Studies; Bone Density; Sampling Studies; Anthropometry; Aging/*physiology; Quality Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between cystatin C and  aging success during a 6-year follow-up in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a  community-based cohort of older adults (aged >or= 65 years). Successful aging was  defined as remaining free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease and having intact physical and cognitive functioning. In adjusted  analysis, an accelerated failure time model was used to evaluate the percentage  reduction in successful years by level of cystatin C. A separate Cox proportional  hazards model evaluated whether cystatin C was related to incident physical and  cognitive disability. RESULTS: A total of 2140 participants had cystatin C measured  and were free of the previously mentioned conditions at baseline. Their mean age was  74 years. The mean cystatin C level, creatinine level, and estimated glomerular  filtration rate were 1.06 mg/L, 0.93 mg/dL, and 78 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively  (to convert cystatin C to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 75; and to convert  creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4).

However, it is not clear  whether high FM or low FFM contribute more to a reduction in physical capacity.  METHODS: A structural equation modeling strategy was used to test an explanatory  model of the association between body composition and physical capacity. The concept  of physical capacity was assessed by walking speed at a normal pace and the one leg  stand test. To test the model, 904 men and women between 67 and 84 years old were  studied. Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).  Confounding factors related to body composition and physical capacities were  included in the explanatory model (physical activity level, age, gender, and number  of reported diseases). RESULTS: The final model showed that physical capacity can be  represented by a factorial first-order model including generic measures of walking  speed and balance. Moreover, our results showed that percentage of FM was  significantly associated with physical capacity (p<.01), whereas no such association  was observed with FFM. Other variables such as physical activity level, number of  self-reported diseases, and age were associated with physical capacity (all p<.01).  Overall, the proposed model explained 48% and 57% of the variance observed in men  and women when using the one leg stand and the walking speed at normal pace tests as  measures of physical capacity. CONCLUSION: FM was significantly and inversely  correlated with physical capacity, whereas FFM was not associated when controlled  for other potential confounding variables. More studies are needed to investigate  the effect of different levels of obesity on physical capacity in older individuals.","2007-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:58:27","","1382-1388","","12","62","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18166689","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Theoretical; *Aging; *Motor Activity; *Body Composition; Adipose Tissue/*metabolism; *Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight young army  volunteers served as subjects over a period of 29 years: 1969, 1979, 1988, 1998. By  1979 three of them became latent diabetics. Complete physical examination,  anthropometric measurements and same procedural protocol was followed in each study.  Samples were collected over 3 hour periods for 24 hours in the middle of each month  of May. Urine aliquots were analyzed for creatinine, using conventional laboratory  procedure. Zn was analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry in 1969, and  1979 and by Inductively Coupled Plasma, in 1988 and 1998. RESULTS: Over the course  of 29 years the circadian distribution of Zn was altered by decrease in amplitude in  Zn levels, while the 24h concentrations of Zn decreased progressively with  increasing age in healthy and diabetic subjects: Healthy; 966+/-130 microg at age of  29; 666+/-14 microg at 39; 511+/-80 microg at 48; and 555+/-71 microg at age of 58y;  Diabetics exhibited similar trend; 1757+/-60 microg at age 28; 1253+/-40 microg at  age 38, 1132+/-31 microg at 47, and 1025+/-11 microg at the age of 57.  Anthropometric measurements in each study period revealed significant increases in  diabetic subjects for body weight, body surface area, BMI and significant decrease  in body heights of both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The daily excretion of urinary Zn over  the 29 years period decreased by 42% in healthy and diabetic subjects. Although  there appears to be a lack of a reliable index of intracellular Zn status to  accurately monitor and control zinc deficiency in younger and older populations, the  present data suggest that depletions of Zn are also evident in healthy aging  subjects whose daily diet was not deficient in zinc.","2007-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","403-408","","5","158","","Clin Ter","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Italy PMID: 18062346","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Male; Adult; Longitudinal Studies; Spectrophotometry, Atomic; *Aging/urine; *Circadian Rhythm; Biomarkers/urine; Creatinine/urine; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/urine; Zinc/*urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trajectory of this volume loss  relative to the timing of the clinical transition to dementia has not been  established. METHODS: The authors annually evaluated 79 healthy elderly subjects for  up to 15 consecutive years with standardized clinical examinations and volumetric  brain MRI assessments of ventricular volume. During the study period, 37 subjects  developed MCI. A mixed effects model with a change point modeled the pattern of  brain volume loss in healthy aging compared with subjects diagnosed with MCI.  RESULTS: The brain loss trajectory of subjects developing MCI during follow-up  differed from healthy aging in a two-phase process. First, the annual rate of  expansion of ventricular volume decreased with age; however, the annual rates of  expansion were greater in those who developed cognitive impairment during follow-up  compared with those who did not. Further, subjects who developed MCI had an  acceleration of ventricular volume expansion approximately 2.3 years prior to  clinical diagnosis of MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular expansion is faster in those  developing mild cognitive impairment years prior to clinical symptoms, and  eventually a more rapid expansion occurs approximately 24 months prior to the  emergence of clinical symptoms. These differential rates of preclinical atrophy  suggest that there are specific windows for optimal timing of introduction of  dementia prevention therapies in the future.","2008-03-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:25:28","","828-833","","11","70","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 18046010","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Abridged Index Medicus; Aging -- pathology; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Brain -- pathology; Prospective Studies; Alzheimer Disease -- diagnosis; Alzheimer Disease -- pathology; Cognition Disorders -- diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- etiology; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Brain -- Pathology; Aging/*pathology; Disease Progression; Brain/pathology; Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/etiology/pathology; Atrophy/diagnosis/etiology/pathology; Cerebral Ventricles/*pathology; Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/*pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods/trends; Cognition Disorders; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods; Atrophy -- pathology; Cognition Disorders -- pathology; Alzheimer Disease -- etiology; Atrophy -- diagnosis; Atrophy -- etiology; Cerebral Ventricles -- pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- trends; Middle Age; Atrophy -- Pathology; Alzheimer's Disease -- Diagnosis; Alzheimer's Disease -- Pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Methods; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Etiology; Alzheimer's Disease -- Etiology; Atrophy -- Diagnosis; Atrophy -- Etiology; Cerebral Ventricles -- Pathology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More information on patterns of driving for older adults is  required to improve service provision and traffic planning. OBJECTIVES: To map the  changes in driving status for a sample of drivers aged 65 years or older over the  period 1994-2000, and to identify factors associated with older people continuing,  modifying or relinquishing their status as drivers. METHODS: The 752 participants  were drawn from the Melbourne Longitudinal Studies on Healthy Ageing (MELSHA)  program, a longitudinal study of people aged 65 years and older living in the  community. Participants were interviewed or contacted for follow-up in 1994, 1996,  1998 and 2000 on a range of topics including their health, functional independence  and driving status. RESULTS: Although the number of recent drivers was smaller as  participants died or were admitted to nursing homes over the 6-year data collection  period, relatively few participants relinquished driving while remaining in the  community. Many drivers reported modifying their driving habits over time, including  decisions to restrict their driving to their local area during daylight only.  Relationships were explored between driving status and the key variables of age,  gender, marital status, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) independence  and self-rated measures of income, health, eyesight and hearing. Multivariate  analyses indicated that drivers were more likely to modify their driving habits if  they were older, dependent in IADL, and rated their eyesight as poor. Similar  factors predicted relinquishing driving, but in addition, women were three times  more likely to relinquish driving than men (even when health and disability were  taken into account) and people who rated their incomes as 'comfortable' were more  likely to relinquish driving than those with lower incomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study  confirmed previous evidence that older drivers self-regulate by modifying their  driving behavior as they age. However, since few drivers voluntarily relinquish  driving, further research is required to identify ways of supporting older drivers  to continue to drive safely.","2007","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","423-431","","6","53","","Gerontology","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2007 S.

Causal relationships of lifestyle-  and diet-related factors in late-life depression are unclear. This study  investigates prospective associations of lifestyle- and diet-related factors with  development of categorically defined late-life depression in a well-documented  population of elderly European men. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Altogether 526  not-demented and not-depressed European men aged 70-89 at baseline were included in  the analyses. The association of lifestyle-related and dietary factors with  development of categorically defined depression (> =48/80 on the Zung Self-rating  Depression Scale) was assessed in a follow-up of 5 years. RESULTS: Eleven percent  (n=59) of the men developed depression during follow-up. An independent association  with development of depression was found for baseline depressive status [Odds Ratio  (OR) 1.19, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.10-1.28, p<0.001], a decline in serum  total cholesterol level between study years (OR 1.76, 95%CI: 1.01-3.04, p=0.045),  physical activity (OR 0.97, 95%CI: 0.94-1.00, p=0.022) and moderate alcohol intake  (OR 0.35, 95%CI: 0.14-0.87, p=0.023) but not for dietary factors. CONCLUSIONS: This  study of a well-documented population of elderly European men confirms that physical  activity and moderate alcohol consumption may protect against depression in the  old-old. Our results are the first to suggest that a decline in serum cholesterol  level may predict development of late-life depression. As the effects of age,  medication and incipient cognitive decline could not be entirely ruled out; this  finding must be interpreted with care.","2008-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:42:36","","478-484","","5","23","","Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17975846","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Energy Intake; Male; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Europe; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Psychological Tests; Multivariate Analysis; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Italy; Netherlands; *Health Status; *Life Style; Finland; Age of Onset; Alcohol Drinking; Diet/*psychology; Alcohol Drinking/*psychology; Depressive Disorder/*etiology; Exercise/*physiology/psychology; Questionnaires; Depression -- Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Physical Activity; Data Analysis Software; Cholesterol -- Blood; Depression -- Epidemiology; Logistic Regression; Two-Tailed Test; Fluid Intake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To develop a definition of healthy ageing and  investigate its association with longevity and neuropathology. METHODS: Analyses  were based on cognitive, physical, and post-mortem assessments from 1991 to 1998 in  the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of ageing in participants 75+ years at baseline.  We defined three mutually exclusive levels of healthy ageing (excellent, very good,  and good) based on measures of global cognitive function, short-term memory, basic  and instrumental activities of daily living, and self-rated function. Mortality  analyses were based on 636 participants; neuropathologic analyses were restricted to  221 who had died and were autopsied. RESULTS: Only 11% of those meeting criteria for  the excellent level of healthy ageing at baseline subsequently died, compared with  24% for the very good, 39% for the good, and 60% for the remaining participants.  Survival curves showed significantly greater longevity with higher levels of healthy  ageing. The risk of not attaining healthy ageing, adjusted for age, increased  two-fold in participants with brain infarcts alone, six-fold in those with Alzheimer  neuropathology alone, and more than thirteen-fold in those with both brain infarcts  and Alzheimer neuropathology. CONCLUSIONS: The biological validity of our definition  of healthy ageing is supported by its strong association with mortality and  longevity. Avoiding Alzheimer and stroke neuropathology is critical to the  maintenance of healthy ageing, and the presence of both pathologies dramatically  decreases the likelihood of healthy ageing.","2007-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:30","","650-655","","6","36","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17906306  PMCID: PMC2243258","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; United States; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Cognition/physiology; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; *Health Status; Geriatric Assessment/*methods; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Longevity/physiology; Aging/pathology/*physiology; *Terminology as Topic; Alzheimer Disease/physiopathology/prevention & control; Catholicism; Clergy; Stroke/physiopathology/prevention & control; Longevity -- Physiology; Alzheimer's Disease -- Physiopathology; Kaplan-Meier Estimator; Geriatric Assessment -- Methods; Nomenclature; Memory, Short Term; Alzheimer's Disease -- Prevention and Control; Stroke -- Physiopathology; Stroke -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated medical, psychological, social and environmental characteristics as both correlates and predictors of elevated nutritional risk in community-dwelling seniors.Methods: Data came from a prospective study of 839 seniors aged 75 and over, in Montreal. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at baseline and at 12 months. The validated Elderly Nutrition Screening (ENS) tool was administered and subjects were assigned a level of ""nutritional risk"" based on the risk for energy and nutritional intake deficiencies. Using risk factors identified in the literature, analyses were performed to characterize those factors associated with both the level of risk at baseline and a change in risk over 12 months.Results: At baseline, more than half (60%) of the participants were at elevated nutritional risk. Cross-sectional analyses supported the findings of previous research examining correlates of elevated nutritional risk. Longitudinal results showed that among those at low nutritional risk, only poor self-rated health was found to be a statistically significant predictor of elevated risk at 12 months (OR = 3.30, p < 0.05).Conclusion: Proper nutrition can promote healthy aging by preventing disease and disability, improving health outcomes and maintaining autonomy, resulting in decreased health care utilization and costs. The findings of this research highlight the need for longitudinal studies in order to better understand and target nutritional risk in community-dwelling seniors.","2007-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:15:58","","331-336","","4","98","","Can J Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17896747  PMCID: PMC6977535","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Nutritional Status; Longitudinal Studies; United States; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Interviews as Topic; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; *Nutritional Status; Housing for the Elderly; *Homes for the Aged; Malnutrition/prevention & control; Interviews; Nutrition Disorders -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS) is a  prospective cohort study based upon participants in a registration network of  general practices in The Netherlands. Information was available on 1211 men and  women, 24-81 years old, who were without cognitive impairment at baseline  (1993-1995), who ever had a paid job, and who participated in the six-year  follow-up. Main outcomes were longitudinal decline in important components of  quality of life and successful aging, i.e., self-reported physical, affective, and  cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Persons with a low occupational level at baseline  showed more functional decline than persons with a high occupational level.  Socio-economic and developmental factors from early life hardly contributed to the  adult socio-economic differences in functional decline. Intellectual abilities,  however, took into account more than one third of the association between adult  socio-economic status and functional decline. The contribution of the intellectual  abilities was independent of the early life factors. CONCLUSION: Rather than  developmental and socio-economic characteristics of early life, the findings  substantiate the importance of intellectual abilities for functional decline and  their contribution--as potential, but neglected confounders--to socio-economic  differences in functioning, successful aging, and quality of life. The higher  intellectual abilities in the higher socio-economic status groups may also underlie  the higher prevalences of mastery, self-efficacy and efficient coping styles in  these groups.","2007-07-25","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:26:46","","179","","","7","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17651498  PMCID: PMC1971068","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Social Class; Cognition Disorders -- epidemiology; *Social Class; Quality of Life/*psychology; Netherlands/epidemiology; Aging/physiology/psychology; Cognition Disorders/economics/*epidemiology; Intelligence Tests/*statistics & numerical data; Occupations/classification/*economics; Sociology, Medical; Quality of Life -- psychology; Cognition Disorders -- economics; Intelligence Tests -- statistics & numerical data; Netherlands -- epidemiology; Occupations -- classification; Occupations -- economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is remarkably  little up-to-date information about the health of the oldest old (over 85 years),  demographically the fastest growing section of the population. There is a need, from  both a policy and scientific perspective, to describe in detail the health status of  this population and the factors that influence individual health trajectories. For a  very large proportion of medical conditions, age is the single largest risk factor.  Gaining new knowledge about why aged cells and tissues are more vulnerable to  pathology is likely to catalyse radical new insights and opportunities to intervene.  The aims of the Newcastle 85+ Study are to expose the spectrum of health within an  inception cohort of 800 85 year-olds; to examine health trajectories and outcomes as  the cohort ages and their associations with underlying biological, medical and  social factors; and to advance understanding of the biological nature of ageing.  METHODS: A cohort of 800 85 year olds from Newcastle and North Tyneside will be  recruited at baseline and followed until the last participant has died. Eligible  individuals will be all those who turn 85 during the year 2006 (i.e. born in 1921)  and who are registered with a Newcastle or North Tyneside general practice.  Participants will be visited in their current residence (own home or institution) by  a research nurse at baseline, 18 months and 36 months. The assessment protocol  entails a detailed multi-dimensional health assessment together with review of  general practice medical records. Participants will be flagged with the NHS Central  Register to provide details of the date and cause of death. DISCUSSION: The  Newcastle 85+ Study will address key questions about health and health-maintenance  in the 85+ population, with a particular focus on quantitative assessment of factors  underlying variability in health, and on the relationships between health, nutrition  and biological markers of the fundamental processes of ageing.","2007-06-26","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:36:45","","14","","","7","","BMC Geriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17594470  PMCID: PMC1924857","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Nutritional Status; Aged, 80 and over -- physiology; Aged, 80 and over -- psychology; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Surveys; Biomarkers; Clinical Protocols; *Health Surveys; Patient Selection; Biomarkers/metabolism; England; *Clinical Protocols; Aged, 80 and over/*physiology/psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Biomarkers -- metabolism; Aged, 80 and over -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is  growing empirical evidence of a positive relationship between religious engagement  and better clinical health outcomes. However, studies exploring the subclinical  levels of physiological dysregulation are rare; hence, the physiological processes  underpinning the religion-health relationship are not well understood. METHODS: In  1988, 853 participants from the MacArthur Successful Aging Study provided  information on the frequency of religious service attendance as well as blood and  urine samples needed to obtain measures for a ten-item cumulative AL index.  Gender-stratified multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the  direction and magnitude of the association between weekly religious service  attendance and AL. RESULTS: At least weekly religious service attendance was  associated with lower AL levels among women (b = -0.47; p < .01), but not among men  (b = 0.02; p = .88) in models that statistically controlled for age, income,  education, marital status, and level of physical functioning. This relationship  could not be attributed to the association between religious attendance and any one  or two of the components of the AL index. It also was not explained by either higher  physical functioning or social integration. CONCLUSION: Cumulative physiological  dysregulation may be one mechanism through which religious engagement may influence  a diverse range of clinically relevant health outcomes.","2007-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:04:53","","464-472","","5","69","","Psychosom Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17567709","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Hydrocortisone; WI4X0X7BPJ; Prospective Studies; Hydrocortisone -- blood; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Blood Pressure; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; T-Tests; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Validation Studies; *Health Status; Lipids/blood; Aging/psychology; Cardiovascular System/*physiopathology; Waist-Hip Ratio; *Spirituality; Cardiovascular Diseases/psychology; Hydrocortisone/blood; Spirituality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- psychology; Cardiovascular System -- physiopathology; Lipids; Lipids -- blood; Questionnaires; Clinical Assessment Tools; Instrument Construction; Secondary Analysis; Religion and Religions; Data Analysis Software; Multiple Linear Regression; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Psychosocial Factors; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; Cardiovascular System -- Physiopathology; Structured Questionnaires; Lipids -- Blood; Hydrocortisone -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reserve perspective is becoming more  sophisticated, but gaps in knowledge persist. In the present research, we considered  three understudied questions about reserve: Is reserve primarily static  (unchangeable) throughout the life course or dynamic (changeable, in terms of  increases or decreases)? Can reserve be increased at any point in life, or are there  optimal time periods--such as early life, midlife, or late life--to increase it?  Does participation in different types of leisure and occupational activities in  early life and midlife have different effects depending on specific domains of  late-life cognitive functioning? Here we link early cognitive and activity  data--gathered from archival sources--with cognitive data from older adults to  examine these issues. DESIGN AND METHODS: 349 participants, all mid-1940s graduates  of the same high school, underwent telephone cognitive screening. All participants  provided access to adolescent IQ scores; we determined activity levels from  yearbooks. We used path analysis to evaluate the complex relationships between early  life, midlife, and late-life variables. RESULTS: Adolescent IQ had strong direct  effects on global cognitive functioning, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and  processing speed. Participants' high school mental activities had direct effects on  verbal fluency, but physical and social activities did not predict any cognitive  measure. Education had direct effects on global cognitive functioning, episodic  memory, and, most strongly, processing speed, but other midlife factors (notably,  occupational demands) were not significant predictors of late-life cognition. There  were weak indirect effects of adolescent IQ on global cognitive functioning,  episodic memory, and processing speed, working through high school mental activities  and education. Verbal fluency, in contrast, was affected by adolescent IQ through  links with high school mental activities, but not education. IMPLICATIONS: Our study  suggests that reserve is dynamic, but it is most amenable to change in early life.  We conclude that an active, engaged lifestyle, emphasizing mental activity and  educational pursuits in early life, can have a positive impact on cognitive  functioning in late life.","2007-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","307-322","","3","47","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17565095","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Adolescent; Retrospective Studies; *Cognition; Aging/*psychology; *Life Style; Education; Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consistent with previous research, we found that social activity was  significantly correlated with overall level of physical functioning, cognitive  functioning, and depression symptomatology. We also found that social activity was  significantly and moderately heritable (estimate of .36), raising the possibility  that its association with late-life functioning might reflect selection processes.  Further, social activity did not predict change in functioning and in monozygotic  twin pairs discordant on level of social activity, the more socially active twin was  not less susceptible to age decreases in physical and cognitive functioning and  increases in depression symptomatology than the less socially active twin. These  results are interpreted in the context of the additional finding that nonshared  environmental factors, although apparently not social activity, are the predominant  determinant of changes in late-life functioning.","2007-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","255-265","","2","10","","Twin Res Hum Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17564515","","","","Aged; Humans; Cognition; Physical Fitness; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; *Social Behavior; Denmark; Aging/*genetics/*psychology; Depression/genetics/psychology; Genetics, Behavioral; Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics/*psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, limited information exists on the association of  diabetes with life expectancy with and without CVD. We aimed to calculate the  association of diabetes after age 50 years with life expectancy and the number of  years lived with and without CVD. METHODS: Using data from the Framingham Heart  Study, we built life tables to calculate the associations of having diabetes with  life expectancy and years lived with and without CVD among populations 50 years and  older. For the life table calculations, we used hazard ratios for 3 transitions  (healthy to death, healthy to CVD, and CVD to death), stratifying by the presence of  diabetes at baseline and adjusting for age and confounders. RESULTS: Having diabetes  significantly increased the risk of developing CVD (hazard ratio, 2.5 for women and  2.4 for men) and of dying when CVD was present (hazard ratio, 2.2 for women and 1.7  for men). Diabetic men and women 50 years and older lived on average 7.5 (95%  confidence interval, 5.5-9.5) and 8.2 (95% confidence interval, 6.1-10.4) years less  than their nondiabetic equivalents. The differences in life expectancy free of CVD  were 7.8 and 8.4 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the risk of CVD  and mortality from diabetes represents an important decrease in life expectancy and  life expectancy free of CVD. Prevention of diabetes is a fundamental task facing  today's society in the pursuit of healthy aging.","2007-06-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1145-1151","","11","167","","Arch Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 17563022","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Risk Assessment; Health Surveys; Proportional Hazards Models; Cardiovascular Diseases/*mortality; United States/epidemiology; *Life Expectancy; Diabetes Mellitus/*mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to evaluate effects of long-term, low-dose T  administration on nocturnal GH secretory dynamics and AM concentrations of IGF-I and  IGFBP-3 in healthy older men (65-88 yr, n = 34) with low-normal T and IGF-I. In a  double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized study we assessed effects of low-dose  T supplementation (100 mg im every 2 wk) for 26 wk on nocturnal GH secretory  dynamics [8 PM to 8 AM, Q(20) min sampling, analyzed by multiparameter deconvolution  and approximate entropy (ApEn) algorithms]. The results were that T administration  increased serum total T by 33% (P = 0.004) and E(2) by 31% (P = 0.009) and decreased  SHBG by 17% (P = 0.002) vs. placebo. T supplementation increased nocturnal  integrated GH concentrations by 60% (P = 0.02) and pulsatile GH secretion by 79% (P  = 0.05), primarily due to a twofold increase in GH secretory burst mass (P = 0.02)  and a 1.9-fold increase in basal GH secretion rate (P = 0.05) vs. placebo. There  were no significant changes in GH burst frequency or orderliness of GH release  (ApEn). IGF-I levels increased by 22% (P = 0.02), with no significant change in  IGFBP-3 levels after T vs. placebo.

A different definition of successful  aging requires that older adults fall at or above the mean level of younger adults  and maintain this level over time. Here we examined this definition of successful  aging in a sample of 1463 individuals between the ages of 50 of 85. Based on  principal coordinate analysis of cognitive and non-cognitive variables, we  identified a group of 55 (8.3%) 70-85 years olds that were high functioning. This  group of elderly showed elevated performance on a range of cognitive tasks.  Non-cognitive factors that characterized this group included education and  subjective health.

The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between active engagement  with life and functioning among the community-dwelling elderly. METHODS: Data were  collected from Wave 2 of the Suwon Longitudinal Aging Study (SLAS), consisting of a  sample of 645 persons aged 65 and older living in the community. A social activity  checklist and social support inventory were used as measures of engagement with  life, along with the Physical Functioning (PF) scale as a measure of functioning.  The effects of social support and social activity on physical functioning, taking  into account the covariates, were analyzed by hierarchical linear regression  analysis. RESULTS: Maintenance of social activity and social support were  significantly associated with higher physical function, after adjusting for  sociodemographic and health-related covariates. Social support appeared to be more  prominent than social activity in predicting physical functioning. CONCLUSIONS:  Social support and social activity are potentially modifiable factors associated  with physical function in older persons. Studies examining the role social  engagement may play in preventing disability are warranted.","2007-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","137-144","","2","40","","J Prev Med Public Health","","","","","","","","kor","","","","","","","Place: Korea (South) PMID: 17426425","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; *Social Support; *Interpersonal Relations; *Activities of Daily Living; Disability Evaluation; Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have investigated the role of dietary patterns on overall mortality in a large series of Italian elderly,  recruited in five EPIC cohorts in Northern (Varese and Turin), Central (Florence)  and Southern Italy (Naples and Ragusa).A total of 5611 subjects (72.6 % women) aged  60 years or older, enrolled in 1993-1998, were prospectively followed (median 6.2  years), with 152 deaths (98 women). Four major dietary patterns were identified by  using an exploratory factor analysis based on dietary information collected at  enrollment. The associations between these dietary patterns and overall mortality  were evaluated by Cox models adjusted for potential confounders. The 'Olive Oil &  Salad' pattern, characterised by a high consumption of olive oil, raw vegetables,  soups and poultry, emerged as being inversely associated with overall mortality in  both crude and adjusted models. After adjustment for gender, age and caloric intake,  overall mortality was reduced by approximately 50 % in the highest quartile and a  significant trend emerged (P = 0.008). This association persisted after adjusting  for several additional confounders (hazard ratio (HR) 0.50; 95 % CI 0.29, 0.86; P  for trend = 0.02). An association of the 'Pasta & Meat' pattern (characterised by  pasta, tomato sauce, red meat, processed meat, added animal fat, white bread and  wine) with increased overall mortality was also suggested, but only for the highest  quartile in a multivariate model. Dietary recommendations aimed at the Italian  elderly population should support a dietary pattern characterised by a high  consumption of olive oil, raw vegetables and poultry.","2007-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","406-415","","2","98","","Br J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17403268","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Animals; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Meat; *Mortality; Aging/physiology; *Feeding Behavior; *Vegetables; Italy/epidemiology; Dietary Carbohydrates/administration & dosage; Dietary Fats/administration & dosage; Poultry; Dietary Fats, Unsaturated/administration & dosage; Olive Oil; Plant Oils/*administration & dosage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depression, as a treatable condition, may be  important in the development of dementia. Our objective was to examine the  association between depressive symptoms and longitudinal cognitive changes in older  adults who were high-functioning at baseline. METHODS: The authors analyzed data  from a community-based cohort (aged 70-79 at baseline), who, at study entry, scored  7 or more (out of 9) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ).  Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline using the depression subscale of the  Hopkins Symptom Check List. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and at  seven-year follow up by the SPMSQ and by summary scores from standard tests of  naming, construction, spatial recognition, abstraction, and delayed recall. RESULTS:  After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, education, and chronic  health conditions such as diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, a higher  number of baseline depressive symptoms were strongly associated with greater  seven-year decline in cognitive performance and with higher odds of incident  cognitive impairment, i.e., decline in SPMSQ score to < or = 6 (adjusted odds ratio  per quartile of depressive symptoms score: 1.34, 95% confidence interval:  1.10-1.68).

METHODS:  Prospective cohort study of 3907 people aged 50+ registered with three general  practices in North Staffordshire, in the UK. The main outcome measures were  self-reported knee pain; general health and physical function as measured by the  Short Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: Of those with no knee pain at baseline, 24% (n =  501) reported it at follow-up. There was a steep decline in physical function in  this group (mean fall in SF-36 score at follow-up 10.3 points) compared with the  1558 persons who had no knee pain at baseline or follow-up (mean fall 3.3). Those  with knee pain at baseline whose pain had resolved at 3-yr follow-up (n = 409)  showed only minor improvements in physical functioning scores at follow-up (mean  improvement -1.3). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of knee pain is associated with a  substantial and persistent reduction of physical function in older adults living in  the community.

The aim of this ten-year follow-up study was to identify factors associated  with increased mortality among 70-year-old subjects living in the community.  METHODS: Data were collected in 1991 by a postal questionnaire sent to all residents  of Turku, Finland, born in 1920. A physical examination was also conducted. Ten  years later, in 2001, the mortality rate of this population was determined. The data  were examined statistically. RESULTS: Many health-related factors, such as smoking,  poor subjective health, and mobility, were related to an increased level of  mortality. In addition, several diseases (e.g., diabetes, angina pectoris, cancer)  at age 70 were associated with increased mortality over ten years. Difficulties in  daily activities at age 70 also increased the risk of mortality.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community-based cohort of healthy  ageing men with symptoms suggestive of AD was studied between May 2001 and February  2003. Men were classified as obese or non-obese according to body mass index (BMI)  or waist circumference (WC). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnosis of AD according to  Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) guidelines. RESULTS: 223 men aged 54-86 years  with mean BMI 27.3 +/- 0.2 kg/m2 (range 20.5-36.2 kg/m2) were recruited; 99 men were  obese (BMI > or = 30.0 kg/m2 or WC > or = 102 cm) and 124 men were non-obese. Obese  men had lower total testosterone (TT) (12.7 +/- 0.4 v 15.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/L); P <  0.001) and calculated free testosterone (275.7 +/- 7.8 v 299.3 +/- 7.4 pmol/L); P =  0.03) levels than non-obese men. TT levels < 8 nmol/L were recorded in 12% of obese  men and 1% of non-obese men. Applying the ESA guidelines for the diagnosis of  age-related AD, 15 obese men (15%) and 4 non-obese men (3%) were classified as being  eligible for androgen therapy supported by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS);  the relative risk in obese men was 1.92 (95% CI, 1.44-2.55; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION:  Obesity is an important determinant of serum TT levels in ageing men. Almost one in  seven obese men but only one in 30 non-obese men in our study were eligible for  PBS-supported androgen therapy according to Australian guidelines. Although obese  men are more likely to have biochemical hypoandrogenism, the clinical implications  of this remain uncertain. Studies of testosterone therapy in this group of ageing  men are needed to determine whether androgen replacement is beneficial.","2006-10-16","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:42:48","","424-427","","8","185","","Med J Aust","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Australia PMID: 17137431","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Male; Body Mass Index; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Aging -- blood; 3XMK78S47O; Testosterone; Testosterone -- blood; Aging/*blood; Testosterone/*blood/*deficiency; Obesity/*blood; Testosterone -- deficiency; Obesity -- blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since there is no instrument that comprehensively assesses complex  mental activity through the lifespan, we developed and tested the Lifetime of  Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a prospective study of healthy ageing. METHOD:  The LEQ assesses educational, occupational and cognitive lifestyle activities at  different stages through life. Test-retest, item analysis and Item Response Theory  (IRT) were used to determine reliability. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor  analysis. Validity was established through IRT analysis of test performance,  correlation with an extant contemporaneous instrument (Cognitive Activities Scale;  CAS) and prediction of global cognitive change over 18 months controlling for age,  baseline cognition and hypertension. RESULTS: In a sample of healthy older  individuals (n=79) the LEQ was found to be consistent, coherent and discriminate  between individuals with high and low mental activity levels. Factor analysis  revealed a dominant factor which loaded heavily on education, occupation and leisure  activity. Total LEQ was significantly correlated with the CAS. Furthermore,  individuals with higher LEQ scores showed less cognitive decline over 18 months,  independent of covariates (r=0.37, p=0.003).

At the same time, religious activity is emerging as a potential  health promoting factor, especially among the elderly. Whether there is a connection  between religious activity and pulmonary function is unknown. PURPOSE: In this  study, we sought to examine the association between religious attendance and rate of  decline in pulmonary function. METHODS: The sample consisted of 1,174 healthy  elderly persons enrolled in the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging who were  followed for an average of 4.6 years. Information on frequency of religious service  attendance and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was collected over 3 waves. A linear  mixed model with repeated measures was used to compare rate of decline in PEFR  between those who attended religious services regularly and those who did not.  RESULTS: Regular religious service attendance was associated with a slower pulmonary  function decline among men (by 3.71 L/min per year, p = .02) and women (by 3.27  L/min per year, p = .02), compared to those who never attend services. The findings  could not be explained by differences in smoking or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS:  Overall findings support the hypothesis that religious activity may play a  protective role in maintaining pulmonary health among the elderly.","2006-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:03:55","","245-253","","3","32","","Ann Behav Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 17107298","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Aging/*physiology; *Religion and Medicine; Lung/*physiology; Peak Expiratory Flow Rate; Lung -- physiology; Religion and Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent  rapid increases in mortality among lower socioeconomic groups in eastern Europe  suggests that socioeconomic factors are powerful determinants of mortality in these  populations but the more proximal factors linking the social conditions with health  remain unclear. The HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern  Europe) study is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the effect of  classical and non-conventional risk factors and social and psychosocial factors on  cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in eastern Europe and the FSU.  The main hypotheses of the HAPIEE study relate to the role of alcohol, nutrition and  psychosocial factors. METHODS AND DESIGN: The HAPIEE study comprises four cohorts in  Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania; each consists of a random sample  of men and women aged 45-69 years old at baseline, stratified by gender and 5 year  age groups, and selected from population registers. The total planned sample size is  36,500 individuals. Baseline information from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland  was collected in 2002-2005 and includes data on health, lifestyle, diet (food  frequency), socioeconomic circumstances and psychosocial factors. A short  examination included measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lung  function and cognitive function, and a fasting venous blood sample. Re-examination  of the cohorts in 2006-2008 focuses on healthy ageing and economic well-being using  face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews. Recruitment of the Lithuanian  cohort is ongoing, with baseline and re-examination data being collected  simultaneously. All cohorts are being followed up for mortality and non-fatal  cardiovascular events. DISCUSSION: The HAPIEE study will provide important new  insights into social, behavioural and biological factors influencing mortality and  cardiovascular risk in the region.","2006-10-18","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","255","","","6","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","PMID: 17049075  PMCID: PMC1626086","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; *Social Class; *Social Conditions; Alcoholism; Cardiovascular Diseases/*economics/epidemiology/mortality; Europe, Eastern/epidemiology; Substance-Related Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: National longitudinal surveys from 1996 to 2002. Setting: Community based. Participants: A national random sample of 12,432 Australian women aged 70 to 75 at baseline. Measurements: Alcohol consumption was the factor of interest, and the main outcome measures were survival and health-related quality of life, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Women who did not consume alcohol or who drank rarely were more likely to die (nondrinkers' hazard ratio (HR) = 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-2.6; rare drinkers' HR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.2-2.1) than women in the low-intake reference category (1-2 drinks per day, 3-6 days per week), or if they survived, they had lower health-related quality-of-life scores on the General Health and Physical Functioning subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Survey after adjustment for smoking, comorbidity, education, body mass index, and area of residence. Nondrinkers also scored lower on the Mental Health and Social Functioning subscales. Conclusion: Being a nondrinker of alcohol was associated with greater risk of death and poorer health-related quality of life. Results for other levels of intake were consistent with current Australian alcohol consumption recommendations for women and indicated that moderate alcohol intake may carry some health benefits for older women in terms of survival and quality of life.

An fMRI study.","NeuroImage","","1053-8119","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.003","","Normal aging is generally associated with declining performance in cognitive and fine motor tasks. Previous functional imaging studies have been inconsistent  regarding the effect of aging on primary motor cortex (M1) activation during finger  movement, showing increased, unchanged or decreased activation contralaterally, and  more consistently increased activation ipsilaterally. Furthermore, no study has  addressed the effect of age on M1 hemispheric activation balance. We studied 18  optimally healthy right-handed subjects, age range 18-79 years (mean +/- SD: 47 +/-  17) using 3 T fMRI and right index finger-thumb tapping auditory-paced at 1.25 Hz.  The weighted Laterality Index (wLI) for M1 was obtained according to Fernandez et  al. (2001) [Fernandez, G., de Greiff, A., von Oertzen, J., Reuber, M., Lun, S.,  Klaver, P., et al. 2001.

The wLI, as well as the total activation on each side, were assessed  against age using non-parametric correlation. There was a highly significant  negative correlation between age and wLI such that the older the subjects, the lower  the wLI. Furthermore, there was a highly significant positive correlation between  total activation for ipsilateral M1 and age, and a nearly significant trend for  contralateral M1. This study documents that during execution of a simple paced motor  task, the older the subject the less lateralized the M1 activation balance as a  result of increasing amount of activation on both sides, more significantly so  ipsilaterally. Thus, in aging, enhanced M1 recruitment bilaterally is required to  produce the same motor performance, suggesting a compensatory process. These  findings are in line with cognitive studies indicating a tendency for the aging  brain to reduce its functional lateralization, perhaps from less efficient  transcallosal connections.","2006-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","1250-1256","","3","32","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16806984","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Prospective Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Algorithms; Brain/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Cues; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Acoustic Stimulation; Fingers/*physiology; Functional Laterality/*physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to  determine whether social integration is associated with inflammatory risk factors  for coronary heart disease, specifically C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6.  The study participants (aged 70 to 79 years; 380 men and 425 women) were from the  MacArthur Successful Aging Study, a longitudinal study of 3 community-based cohorts  in the United States of older adults with relatively high physical and cognitive  functioning at baseline (1988 to 1989). The plasma concentrations of interleukin-6  and CRP were assessed using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were performed. Multivariate adjusted  analyses indicated that social integration was significantly inversely associated  with CRP concentration in men after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking,  alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, cardiovascular disease,  other major or chronic conditions, physical functioning, socioeconomic status, and  depression (odds ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.76, for elevated CRP  [>3.19 mg/L] in the least socially integrated quartile vs the most socially  integrated quartile). No significant associations were found between social  integration and interleukin-6 in men or either inflammatory marker in women. In  conclusion, social integration was negatively associated with the plasma CRP  concentration in men. These findings suggest a potential biologic mechanism for the  observed associations between social integration and coronary heart disease in  prospective studies. Differences may exist between women and men in the biologic  pathways associated with social integration.","2006-04-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:06:25","","1010-1016","","7","97","","Am J Cardiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16563907","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Interpersonal Relations; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Cohort Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Age Factors; Social Support; 9007-41-4; C-Reactive Protein; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-6 -- blood; *Interpersonal Relations; Interleukin-6/*blood; C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism; Coronary Disease/*blood/*psychology; C-Reactive Protein -- metabolism; Coronary Disease -- blood; Coronary Disease -- psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neopterin is a  pteridine derivative, released from macrophages upon stimulation with  pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma. Forty-three probable AD patients were  investigated at baseline and follow up (14.5+/-0.5 months; mean+/-s.e.m.). We  assessed the clinical progression by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for  Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) battery and compared cognitive changes to serum  concentrations of neopterin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and antibody to  cytomegalovirus (CMV). The mean neopterin concentrations increased significantly  from 9.8+/-1.0 to 13.6+/-2.1 nM (p=0.04). In contrast, mean CRP concentrations at  baseline was 0.46+/-0.1 and non-significantly decreased to 0.28+/-0.04 mg/dl. Of AD  patients 70% were CMV IgG-seropositive at baseline and CMV-antibody concentrations  correlated with levels of neopterin (Spearman r=0.386, p=0.016). CERAD scores did  not correlate with any of immune parameters at baseline. At follow up, the increase  of neopterin correlated significantly with the decrease in the total CERAD and MMSE  scores, according to the clinical progression (r=-0.353, p<0.05 and r=-0.401,  p<0.01, respectively). Subdividing the sample with respect to baseline MMSE scores,  neopterin concentrations significantly increased only in the group of MMSE<20. In  the multiple testing covariated for age, gender, Apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 allele,  time difference between both measurements, neopterin remained significantly  associated with cognitive decline. In summary, neopterin concentrations correlated  with cognitive decline in AD patients, which might be due to high CMV seropositivity  in that population.","2007-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","694-701","","8","41","","J Psychiatr Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16542679","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Mental Status Schedule; Disease Progression; Registries; C-Reactive Protein/metabolism; Alzheimer Disease/*diagnosis/immunology; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Cognition Disorders/*diagnosis/immunology; Cytomegalovirus/immunology; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Neopterin/*blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants included 547 noninstitutionalized septuagenarians and  octogenarian residents of a comprehensive care retirement community who were studied  over three years. Latent growth curves (LGC) of multiple cognitive measures were  compared to a LGC model of the rates of change in Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). All curves were standardized  relative to each variable's baseline distribution. Baseline scores were within their  expected normal age-specific ranges. Most measures showed significant rates of  change over time. There was also significant variability about those rates,  suggesting clinical heterogeneity. Many deteriorated over time, as did ADLs and  IADLs. However, performance on some measures improved, consistent with learning  effects. The rates of change in two measures, the Executive Interview and the Trail  Making Test, were closely related to decline in IADLs. These results suggest that  age-related cognitive decline is a dynamic longitudinal process affecting multiple  cognitive domains. Heterogeneity in the rates of cognitive change may reflect the  summed effects of age and comorbid conditions affecting cognition. Some measures may  be ill-suited for measuring age-related changes in cognition, either because they  are insensitive to change, or hindered by learning effects. Nonverbal measures  appear to be particularly well suited for the prediction of age-related functional  decline. These observations are relevant to the definition and diagnosis of  ""dementing"" conditions.","2005-11","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","899-909","","7","11","","J Int Neuropsychol Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 16519269","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; Cognition/*physiology; Aging/*psychology; Memory/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Verbal Behavior/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SETTING: Cache County, Utah, which is among the areas with the highest  conditional life expectancy at age 65 in the United States. PARTICIPANTS:  Inhabitants of Cache County aged 65 and older (January 1, 1995). MEASUREMENTS:  Self-reported overall health and 10 specific dimensions of healthy aging:  independent living, vision, hearing, activities of daily living, instrumental  activities of daily living, absence of physical illness, cognition, healthy mood,  social support and participation, and religious participation and spirituality.  RESULTS: This elderly population was healthy overall. With few exceptions, 80% to  90% of persons aged 65 to 75 were healthy according to each measure used. Prevalence  of excellent and good self-reported health decreased with age, to approximately 60%  in those aged 85 and older.

The predictors of overall self-reported health are distinct from the predictors of  survival in this age group and, being potentially modifiable, are amenable to  clinical and public health efforts.","2006-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:44:22","","199-209","","2","54","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 16460369","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Aging -- Physiology; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Comparative Studies; Retrospective Studies; Self Report; Cognition/physiology; Longevity/*physiology; *Health Status; *Quality of Life; *Activities of Daily Living; Aging/*physiology; Self-Assessment; *Religion; Survival Rate/trends; Hearing/physiology; Utah; Vision, Ocular/physiology; Longevity -- Physiology; Questionnaires; Health Status -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Surveys; Interviews; Activities of Daily Living -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Retrospective Design; Quality of Life -- In Old Age; Cognition -- In Old Age; Self Assessment; Spirituality -- In Old Age; Support, Psychosocial -- In Old Age; Health Status -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Old Age; Longevity -- Psychosocial Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study in 866  Runners' Association members (n = 492) and community controls (n = 374). Subjects  were also categorized as Ever-Runners (n = 565) and Never-Runners (n = 301) to  include runners who had stopped running. Pain was the primary outcome measure and  was assessed in annual surveys on a double-anchored visual analogue scale (0 to 100;  0 = no pain). Baseline differences between Runners' Association members and  community controls and between Ever-Runners versus Never-Runners were compared using  chi-square and t-tests. Statistical adjustments for age, body mass index (BMI),  gender, health behaviors, history of arthritis and comorbid conditions were  performed using generalized estimating equations. Runner's Association members were  younger (62 versus 65 years, p < 0.05), had a lower BMI (22.9 versus 24.2, p <  0.05), and less arthritis (35% versus 41%, p > 0.05) than community controls.  Runners' Association members averaged far more exercise minutes per week (314 versus  123, p < 0.05) and miles run per week (26 versus 2, p < 0.05) and tended to report  more fractures (53% versus 47%, p > 0.05) than controls. Ever-Runners were younger  (62 versus 66 years, p < 0.05), had lower BMI (23.0 versus 24.3, p < 0.05), and less  arthritis (35% versus 43%, p < 0.05) than Never-Runners. Ever-Runners averaged more  exercise minutes per week (291 versus 120, p < 0.05) and miles run per week (23  versus 1, p < 0.05) and reported a few more fractures (52% versus 48%, p > 0.05)  than Never-Runners. Exercise was associated with significantly lower pain scores  over time in the Runners' Association group after adjusting for gender, baseline  BMI, and study attrition (p < 0.01). Similar differences were observed for  Ever-Runners versus Never-Runners.

Data from a 4-year longitudinal study on aging among  5632 older Italians were used. The definition of vitality was based on both  cognitive and physical status, and the envisaged transitions were: positive or  nonpositive stable, positive or negative transition, lost, and deceased. Predictors  associated with different vitality trajectories were investigated by multinomial  logistic analysis with a six-level outcome. Age and educational level were  predictors of being ""positive stable,"" whereas the other factors behaved differently  according to comparison group. For example, being overweight is a common predictor  except when compared to the deceased group, as is depressive symptomatology except  when compared to the ""positive transition"" group. Interventions are warranted to  reduce social inequalities, promote adequate body weight, and prevent and treat  depressive symptoms.","2005-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:14:42","","566-573","","5","60","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15972603","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Surveys and Questionnaires; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Predictive Value of Tests; Life Expectancy; Probability; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Italy; Exercise/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Physical Fitness/*physiology; *Mental Health; Depression/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Vitalism; Depression -- Diagnosis; Depression -- Epidemiology; Logistic Regression; Physical Fitness -- Physiology; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; Philosophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Participants (ages 70-79; n = 375 men and 425 women) were part of the  MacArthur Successful Aging Study, a longitudinal study from three community-based  cohorts in the United States, who have relatively high physical and cognitive  functioning. Social integration was measured using a social integration score, which  assessed marital status, number of contacts with family and friends, frequency of  religious service attendance, and participation in voluntary organizations.  Fibrinogen concentrations were measured in plasma using an automated clot-rate  assay. Cross-sectional multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.  RESULTS: Social integration was significantly associated with elevated  concentrations of fibrinogen (>336 mg/dL) in men after adjusting for smoking,  alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, comorbidity, physical  functioning, depression, age, race, and education (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-4.89, p = .03 for having elevated fibrinogen in the  least integrated quartile versus the most integrated quartile). There was no  significant association between social integration and fibrinogen in women  (multivariate-adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.27-1.21, p = .15). CONCLUSIONS: Social  integration is associated with fibrinogen concentrations in elderly men. This  provides evidence of a biologic mechanism that may help explain the observed  associations between social integration and mortality in men. There may be gender  differences in the physiological pathways by which social integration influences  health.","2005-06","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:56:57","","353-358","","3","67","","Psychosom Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15911896","","","","Aged; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Social Environment; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sex Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Age Factors; *Social Support; Social Isolation; Friends; Marital Status; Family Characteristics; Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/*psychology; Fibrinogen/*analysis; Spirituality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/60.3.391","","Background: Assessment referrals are increasing for unexpected dysphagia, particularly for older people. It is unclear if this is due to more impaired swallows or healthy age-related changes. Swallow respiration coordination prevents aspiration, and may deteriorate with age. Nonpathological features of the swallow in healthy aging and the factors that influence an individual's ability to eat and drink safely need greater understanding. Some changes might predispose an older person to dysphagic complications in the event of an insult such as a stroke. We investigated the effects of healthy aging on resting and swallow respiratory patterns.Methods: Fifty healthy volunteers (aged 20-78 years) were recruited to have swallow respiration patterns recorded on a computer. Bolus volume and consistency variations were studied: 5 and 20 ml of water and 5 ml of yogurt.Results: Measurable swallows significantly decreased with age for water boluses. Swallow apnea increased with age (5 ml of water r = 0.433, p = .002; 5 ml of yogurt r = 0.367, p = .023). Independent of age were: breathing out (occurred after 98% of boluses); multiple swallowing (occurred with all bolus types); post-swallow respiration reset pattern (more irregular after yogurt, Wilcoxon signed rank Z = -2.236, p = .025); and resting respiration.Conclusions: Subtle changes occur in swallow respiration coordination with age. These changes may be compensatory protective mechanisms rather than the result of decreased muscle mobility or reaction times, and not indicative of impairment. Misattributing healthy age-related changes to impairment affects patient care and the use of healthcare resources.","2005-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:47:30","","391-395","","3","60","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15860480","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Adult; Cohort Studies; Reference Values; Deglutition -- physiology; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Probability; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Aging/physiology; Deglutition/*physiology; Statistics, Nonparametric; Apnea/*diagnosis; Deglutition Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Respiration; Respiratory Mechanics; Apnea -- diagnosis; Deglutition Disorders -- diagnosis; Deglutition Disorders -- epidemiology; Middle Age; Apnea -- Diagnosis; Deglutition -- Physiology; Deglutition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Deglutition Disorders -- Epidemiology; Diagnosis, Computer Assisted; Nonparametric Statistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal,  prospective cohort study conducted in Dubbo, NSW. Participants were men and women  aged 60 years or over living in the community, first assessed in 1988-1989 and  followed for 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality rates; risk factors;  survival times. RESULTS: There were 668 deaths in 1233 men (54%) and 625 deaths in  1572 women (40%). Coronary heart disease was the major cause of death, rates being  higher in men than women until age group 80+ years; stroke death rates were similar  in both sexes; cancer and respiratory death rates were higher in men than women  across all ages. In a proportional hazards model, the independent predictors of  mortality were cigarette smoking, diabetes, very high blood pressure (BP), impaired  peak expiratory flow (PEF), physical disability, and zero intake of alcohol. Over 15  years, the average reductions in survival time associated with various risk factors,  in men and women respectively, were smoking, 22 and 15 months; diabetes, 18 and 18  months; very high BP, 16 and 9 months; impaired PEF, 14 and 17 months; physical  disability, 16 and 12 months; zero alcohol intake, 9 and 5 months.

Further, high homocysteine levels are associated with low vitamin status,  and it is unknown whether it is homocysteine toxicity or vitamin insufficiency that  is responsible for the observed cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: We performed  cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a cohort of 499 high-functioning  community-dwelling persons aged 70 to 79 years to determine the effect of  homocysteine and related vitamin plasma concentrations on cognitive function and  cognitive decline. Nonfasting plasma concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin  B(6), and vitamin B(12) were measured at baseline. Summary measures of cognitive  function were created from tests of multiple cognitive domains administered at  baseline and again after 7 years. RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses investigating  each variable separately, subjects with elevated homocysteine levels, or low levels  of folate or vitamin B(6), demonstrated worse baseline cognitive function. In  longitudinal analyses, after adjusting for multiple covariates, including  homocysteine, those in the bottom quartile of folate had a 1.6-fold increased risk  (95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 2.31; P =0.04) of being in the worst quartile of  7-year cognitive decline. Low folate levels largely accounted for a trend towards  greater cognitive decline with elevated homocysteine level. CONCLUSION: In  high-functioning older adults, low folate levels appear to be a risk factor for  cognitive decline. The risk of developing cognitive decline might be reduced through  dietary folate intake.","2005-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:08:46","","161-167","","2","118","","Am J Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15694902","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Alzheimer Disease -- physiopathology; Cognition Disorders -- etiology; 0LVT1QZ0BA; Homocysteine; Homocysteine -- blood; Aging/*psychology; Homocysteine/*blood; Alzheimer Disease/*etiology/physiopathology; Cognition Disorders/*etiology/physiopathology; Folic Acid Deficiency/complications; Folic Acid/*blood; Vitamin B 12/*blood; Vitamin B 6/*blood; Cognition Disorders -- physiopathology; 935E97BOY8; Folic Acid; Folic Acid -- blood; Alzheimer Disease -- etiology; 8059-24-3; Folic Acid Deficiency -- complications; P6YC3EG204; Vitamin B 12; Vitamin B 12 -- blood; Vitamin B 6; Vitamin B 6 -- blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using data from the Massachusetts Male Ageing Study (MMAS), we  estimated age-specific, normal androgen levels for men aged 40-79 years while  accounting for health status and behavioural factors known to influence hormone  levels. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. PATIENTS: Community-based random  sample of men aged 40-79 years: n = 1677 men studied at T1 (1987-1989), n = 1031 at  T2 (1995-1997) and n = 631 at T3 (2002-2004), for a total of 3339 observations. The  average number of years between the T1 and T2 interviews was 8.8 (range 7.1-10.4  years) and 6.4 (range 5.6-7.9 years) between T2 and T3. MEASUREMENTS: Serum total  testosterone (T) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured on nonfasting  blood samples collected within 4 h of subject's awakening. Free and bio-available T  were calculated from T and SHBG using the Sodergard equation. Trained interviewers  administered an in-home questionnaire of health, medication and lifestyle.  Participants were considered apparently healthy if all of the following were met:  (i) absence of self-reported chronic disease (diabetes, heart disease, high blood  pressure, cancer, ulcer); (ii) not on prescription medication believed to affect  hormone levels; (iii) body mass index (BMI) not exceeding 29 kg/m2; (iv) alcohol  consumption less than or equal to six drinks/day; and (v) nonsmoking. RESULTS:  Chronic disease and high BMI significantly decreased whereas smoking tended to  increase total, free and bio-available T concentrations. Apparently healthy men had  significantly higher median hormone concentrations at most time points than did not  apparently healthy men. Due to the opposite effects of smoking and the other  components of the definition, apparently healthy men were compared to nonsmoking,  apparently unhealthy men. The former group had significantly higher androgen levels  (Wilcoxon rank-sum P-values ranged from 0.01 to 0.0001) for all hormones at all  interviews. Ninety-five percent of apparently healthy men in their 40s, 50s, 60s and  70s would be expected to have total T in the range (2.5-97.5th percentile):  8.7-31.7, 7.5-30.4, 6.8-29.8 and 5.4-28.4 nm (251-914, 216-876, 196-859, 156-818  ng/dl), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Age, health and lifestyle factors impact androgen  levels and should be accounted for in calculations of normal reference ranges. We  propose the following age-specific thresholds, below which a man is considered to  have an abnormally low total T: 8.7, 7.5, 6.8 and 5.4 nm (251, 216, 196 and 156  ng/dl) for men in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s, respectively.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences","","1079-5006","10.1093/gerona/59.8.m849","","Background: It remains unclear to what extent the associations between low serum beta-carotene concentration and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancers are attributable to inflammation. The objective of this study was to evaluate simultaneously the effects of serum beta-carotene concentration and inflammation on the subsequent all-cause mortality risk in high-functioning older persons.Methods: The authors conducted a prospective cohort study using information from 672 participants from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging. Baseline information was obtained for serum concentrations of beta-carotene, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, cholesterols, and albumin; body mass index; waist:hip ratio; prevalent medical conditions; health behaviors; and medications. Sex-specific univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to study the effects of low beta-carotene, high inflammation burden, or both on 7-year all-cause mortality rates while adjusting for other confounders.Results: The serum beta-carotene concentration was inversely associated with C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels. After adjustment for inflammation markers and other covariates, the relative risks for low beta-carotene for the 7-year all-cause mortality risk were 2.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 4.31) in men and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.75) in women. Compared with men with high beta-carotene levels and low inflammation, the multiply adjusted relative risk for low beta-carotene and high inflammation burden was 3.78 (95% CI, 1.69 to 8.47) in men.Conclusions: Low levels of serum beta-carotene are independently associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk in older men, even after adjustment for the effects of inflammation and other risk factors. In men, but not women, a synergistic effect occurs between low beta-carotene concentration and high inflammation burden in predicting higher mortality rates.","2004-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:39:22","","849-854","","8","59","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 The Gerontological Society of America","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15345737","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; Interleukin-6/blood; beta Carotene/*blood; Inflammation/*complications; C-Reactive Protein -- Analysis; Interleukins -- Blood; Beta Carotene -- Blood; Inflammation -- Complications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Medicare Part A hospital utilization data were linked to data from the MacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging Community Study to examine the association between baseline cognition and decline in cognitive function over a 3-year period and any hospitalization over that same period. SETTING: New Haven, Connecticut, and East Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=598) were from two sites of the MacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging Community Study, a 7-year cohort study of community-dwelling older persons with high physical and cognitive functioning. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between any hospitalization over 3 years (1988-91) as the outcome variable and baseline cognitive function and decline in cognition over 3 years as primary predictor variables. Decline was based upon repeated (1988 and 1991) measures of delayed verbal recall and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). RESULTS: Of 598 subjects, 48 died between 1988 and 1991. No baseline (1988) delayed recall scores or change in recall scores (1988-91) were associated with hospitalization. Although 48.2% declined on verbal memory scores, decline was not associated with risk of hospitalization. Of 494 subjects with complete 3-year data, 31.2% declined at least one point on the SPMSQ, and 4.7% declined more than two points. Among individuals aged 75 and older at baseline, the adjusted odds ratio for hospitalization for those who declined more than 2 points compared with those who declined less was 7.8 (95% confidence interval=2.0-30.8). CONCLUSION: Although specific memory tests were not associated with hospitalization, high-functioning older persons who experienced decline in overall cognitive function were more likely to be hospitalized. Variation in baseline cognitive function in this high-functioning cohort did not affect hospitalization, but additional research is needed to evaluate associations with other healthcare costs.","2004-09","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 20:28:32","","1456-1462","","9","52","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","Copyright 2004 American Geriatrics Society","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15341546","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Age Factors; Confidence Intervals; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Race Factors; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Disease Progression; Comorbidity; Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data; Medicare; Massachusetts; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Boston/epidemiology; Cognition Disorders/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology; Connecticut/epidemiology; Insurance Claim Reporting/statistics & numerical data; Medicare Part A/statistics & numerical data; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/etiology; Connecticut; Comorbidity -- In Old Age; Logistic Regression; Aged, Hospitalized; Cognition Disorders -- Complications -- In Old Age; Disease Progression -- In Old Age; Institutionalization -- In Old Age; Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Time Factors -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little is known  about the magnitude or pattern of fat distribution and its association with healthy  aging. OBJECTIVE: This study describes approximately 10-y changes in body  composition at 11 anthropometric sites in elderly persons and the metabolic and  physical activity factors associated with these changes. DESIGN: Skinfold  thicknesses, girths, body fat by hydrodensitometry, physical activity by  questionnaire, and metabolic variables were examined twice, 9.4 +/- 1.4 y apart, in  54 men and 75 women aged 60.4 +/- 7.8 y at baseline. RESULTS: Subcutaneous fat  declined (-17.2%; P < 0.001), whereas total fat mass increased (7.2%; P < 0.05).  Waist and hip circumference changes were the best anthropometric predictors of total  fat mass change (r(2) = 0.40-0.65, P < 0.0001). Thigh girth change was more strongly  associated with fat-free mass change (r(2) = 0.22, P < 0.01) than with fat mass  change (r(2) = 0.07, P < 0.05) in women. An increase in physical activity was  associated with an attenuation of thigh girth decline in men and women (F ratio =  5.13, P < 0.007). Traditional metabolic markers of visceral adiposity  (triacylglycerol, glucose, and total cholesterol) were not significantly related to  the change in waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Skinfold thicknesses cannot be used  to assess changes in body fat mass because of age-related fat redistribution. Higher  levels of physical activity can attenuate the decline in appendicular lean tissue  expected over 10 y. Waist and thigh girths, rather than skinfold thicknesses, should  be considered for use in longitudinal studies in the elderly because the changes in  these girths capture increased abdominal adiposity and sarcopenia, respectively.","2004-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:32:04","","475-482","","2","80","","Am J Clin Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 15277173","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Sex Factors; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Analysis of Variance; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Geriatric Assessment/methods; Aging/*physiology; *Body Composition; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Cholesterol/blood; Blood Glucose; *Adipose Tissue; *Anthropometry; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Analysis of Covariance; Gerontologic Care; Repeated Measures; Data Analysis Software; Post Hoc Analysis; Statistical Significance; Linear Regression; Adipose Tissue Distribution -- In Old Age; Body Composition -- In Old Age; Body Weights and Measures -- Trends -- In Old Age; Cholesterol -- Blood; Energy Metabolism -- In Old Age; Hydrodensitometry; Kruskal-Wallis Test; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Physical Activity -- In Old Age; Skinfold Thickness -- Evaluation; Skinfold Thickness -- In Old Age; Waist-Hip Ratio -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alzheimer's disease is associated with progressive cerebral  atrophy, which can be seen on MRI with high resolution. Longitudinal MRI could track  disease progression and detect neurodegenerative diseases earlier to allow prompt  and specific treatment. Such use of MRI requires accurate understanding of how brain  changes in normal ageing differ from those in dementia. STARTING POINT: Recently,  Henry Rusinek and colleagues, in a 6-year longitudinal MRI study of initially  healthy elderly subjects, showed that an increased rate of atrophy in the medial  temporal lobe predicted future cognitive decline with a specificity of 91% and  sensitivity of 89% (Radiology 2003; 229: 691-96). WHERE NEXT? As understanding of  neurodegenerative diseases increases, specific disease-modifying treatments might  become available. Serial MRI could help to determine the efficacy of such  treatments, which would be expected to slow the rate of atrophy towards that of  normal ageing, and might also detect the onset of neurodegeneration. The amount and  pattern of excess atrophy might help to predict the underlying pathological process,  allowing specific therapies to be started. As the precision of imaging improves, the  ability to distinguish healthy ageing from degenerative dementia should improve.","2004-01-31","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","392-394","","9406","363","","Lancet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15074306","","","","Aged; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Atrophy; Aging/*pathology; Brain/*pathology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Alzheimer Disease/*pathology; Hippocampus/pathology; Temporal Lobe/pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: The CSHA began in 1991, with follow-ups in 1996 and  2001. It was national in scope, with 18 study centres and a coordinating centre. It  included 10 263 participants; of these, 9008 were in the community, and 1255 were in  institutions. In each phase, community participants were screened for cognitive  impairment, and where appropriate, cognitive status was determined by a detailed  clinical examination. Data on possible risk factors for dementia were collected at  baseline. Data on caring for people with dementia were collected in each phase.  RESULTS: The prevalence of dementia was established at 8% of those aged 65 years and  over; incidence (new cases each year) was about 2%. Cognitive impairment not  dementia (CIND) was more than twice as common as dementia. Factors affecting the  risk of institutionalization, mortality, and the health of caregivers were examined.  The costs of dementia were conservatively estimated at dollar 3.9 billion in 1991.  Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia are presented; it is  noteworthy that physical activity appeared to protect against all forms of cognitive  decline, particularly for women. Clinical contributions include the development of  norms for several neuropsychological tests. Other topics include the health of those  with CIND, predicting dementia, medication use, frailty and healthy aging, and  urinary incontinence.

Logistic regression analyses revealed that a cumulative index of  biological risk explained 35.4% of the difference in mortality risk between those  with higher versus lower SES (as measured by less than high school education versus  high school or greater educational attainment). Importantly, the cumulative index  provided independent explanatory power, over and above a measure of doctor-diagnosed  disease, though the latter also contributed to education-related variation in  mortality risks. The summary measure of biological risk also accounted for more  variance than individual biological parameters, suggesting the potential value of a  multi-systems view of biological pathways through which SES ultimately affects  morbidity and mortality.","2004-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:14:07","","1985-1997","","10","58","","Soc Sci Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 15020014","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Female; Male; Educational Status; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Confidence Intervals; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Interviews as Topic; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; P-Value; *Mortality; *Social Class; *Educational Status; Aging/pathology/*physiology; Boston/epidemiology; Connecticut/epidemiology; North Carolina/epidemiology; *Adaptation, Physiological; Allosteric Regulation/physiology; Sociology, Medical/methods; Data Analysis Software; Data Analysis, Statistical; Logistic Regression; Mortality -- Trends -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However,  objective scientific validation of the putative health benefits of Lingzhi in human  subjects is lacking, and issues of possible toxicity must be addressed. The present  double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over intervention study investigated the  effects of 4 weeks Lingzhi supplementation on a range of biomarkers for antioxidant  status, CHD risk, DNA damage, immune status, and inflammation, as well as markers of  liver and renal toxicity. It was performed as a follow-up to a study that showed  that antioxidant power in plasma increased after Lingzhi ingestion, and that 10 d  supplementation was associated with a trend towards an improved CHD biomarker  profile. In the present study, fasting blood and urine from healthy, consenting  adults (n 18; aged 22-52 years) was collected before and after 4 weeks  supplementation with a commercially available encapsulated Lingzhi preparation (1.44  g Lingzhi/d; equivalent to 13.2 g fresh mushroom/d) or placebo. No significant  change in any of the variables was found, although a slight trend toward lower  lipids was again seen, and antioxidant capacity in urine increased. The results  showed no evidence of liver, renal or DNA toxicity with Lingzhi intake, and this is  reassuring. The present study of the effects in healthy, well-nourished subjects  provides useful, new scientific data that will support controlled intervention  trials using at-risk subjects in order to assess the therapeutic effect of Lingzhi  in the promotion of healthy ageing.","2004-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","263-269","","2","91","","Br J Nutr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 14756912","","","","Humans; Middle Aged; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; DNA Damage; Biomarkers/blood; Lipids/blood; Antioxidants/metabolism; *Reishi; Drugs, Chinese Herbal/adverse effects/*pharmacology; Phytotherapy/adverse effects/*methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were followed up in 1994-5, 1997-8 and in this fourth wave  of the project, 1999-2000, to determine key predictors of, and associations with  successful ageing. METHODS: Current status of all cohort participants was  determined. Those traced and alive were invited for re-assessment. Those who agreed  underwent psychometric testing, including memory and fluid intelligence tests, a  number of physiological measurements, including blood pressure, grip strength and  respiratory function, and questionnaires were administered enquiring about  disability, self-esteem, and a range of socioeconomic and socioenvironmental items.  RESULTS: At Wave 4, 201 participants were visited and re-tested adequately. During  follow-up, mortality (N = 210) was predicted by gender, occupation, premorbid  intelligence and blood pressure. Disability related to age, weight, respiratory  function, grip strength and current mental ability. A model of health was developed  that comprised dimensions of medical well-being (absence of disease), physiological  fitness and self-perceived health. The latter related strongly to disability and  pre-morbid intelligence. Except for memory score at Wave 3, medical well-being  related poorly to any predictor variable from Waves 1-3. Physiological fitness  related to age, gender and current mental ability. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of  successful ageing is complex, but this cohort of older people related their  perceived health closely to lack of disability. In this cohort, current  socioeconomic and socioenvironmental factors were not strongly linked with health at  this age.","2003-08","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:56:02","","336-342","","4","15","","Aging Clin Exp Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: Germany PMID: 14661826","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Cognition; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Blood Pressure; *Health Status; Scotland; Disabled Persons/*classification; Disabled Persons -- classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was based on 8-year follow-up data; 843 persons aged 65-84 were involved in the first phase of the study, and 426 persons aged 73-92, in the second phase. Loosely, on the basis of the distinction between successful, usual, and pathological aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1987, 1997), participants were grouped according to their self-ratings of cognitive and physical functioning as 'Positive,' 'Negative,' and 'Others.' Participants possessing at least 4 out of the 5 criteria used as indicators of successful aging in the study (no illness or injury presenting problems in daily life, no health problems imposing limitations on hobbies, self-rated cognitive functioning better than satisfactory, age-comparative functional capacity as good, and no signs of depression) were assigned to the 'Positive' group. The results showed these individuals typically to have a more youthful age identity, indicated by a lower feel age and thus a lower subjective age-perception score, lower mental, physical, and look ages, and a less frequently reported sense of age weighing on them. Moreover, this group reported a higher ideal age and had a chronological age satisfaction score closer to 0, suggesting higher satisfaction with chronological age. Also a tendency to set the onset of old age later and a willingness to live to 100 years of age were features that were more characteristic of the 'Positive' than the other groups. The findings, supported by multivariate analyses, were in line with those of previous variable-oriented studies on age identification, suggesting that an association exists between perceptions of personal aging and physical and psychological well-being.","2003","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 19:21:22","","173-195","","3","56","","Int J Aging Hum Dev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14661812","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Adaptation, Psychological; Prospective Studies; Psychological Tests; Multivariate Analysis; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Human; Scales; Linear Models; *Health Status; Finland; *Mental Health; *Self Concept; *Social Identification; Aged/*psychology; Interviews; Coefficient Alpha; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Aging -- Evaluation -- Finland; Health Beliefs; Linear Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among those without clinical disease, high levels of subclinical disease are  associated with poor survival. The effect of the extent of subclinical  cardiovascular disease on the quality of the remaining years has not been defined.  METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort study, 2932 men and women aged 65 years and older  were followed up for 8 years to determine the likelihood of maintaining intact  health and functioning. Successful aging was defined as remaining free of  cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with  intact physical and cognitive functioning. RESULTS: Younger age at study entry and a  lower extent of subclinical cardiovascular disease were independently associated  with the likelihood of maintaining successful aging. In age-stratified summaries,  those with subclinical disease had a trajectory of decline similar to subjects 5  years older without subclinical vascular disease. Regression analyses showed that  the decline associated with subclinical disease was equivalent to 6.5 (95%  confidence interval, 6.4-6.6) years of aging for women and 5.6 (95% confidence  interval, 5.4-5.8) years of aging for men. Individual measures of the extent of  cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and higher C-reactive protein  level were also independently predictive of fewer years of successful aging, but  none of these factors substantially attenuated the effect of age itself.  CONCLUSIONS: There is a graded relationship between the extent of vascular disease  measured noninvasively and the likelihood of maintaining intact health and function.

Our recent survey of an elderly male population asked  respondents to define ""successful aging."" This paper describes the themes that  evolved from those definitions, explores interrelationships between the themes, and  examines the association between characteristics of respondents and the themes  provided in their definition. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Manitoba Follow-up Study has  followed a cohort of 3,983 World War II Royal Canadian Air Force male aircrew  recruits since July 1, 1948. At a mean age of 78 years in 1996, the survivors were  surveyed and asked, ""What is your definition of successful aging?"" and ""Would you  say you have aged successfully?"" A content analysis identified themes emerging from  their definitions. RESULTS: The most frequent of the 20 component themes from the  definitions of successful aging as provided by 30% of the 1,771 respondents related  to ""health and disease""; ""physical,"" ""mental,"" and ""social activity"" were more  likely to be found in a definition including ""interest,"" ""having goals,"" ""family,""  or ""diet,"" and they were less likely to be mentioned with themes of ""independence""  or ""health."" Many of the themes reflect an individual's attitudes toward life and  the aging process. Current life satisfaction, self-rated health, and limitation in  activities of daily living were significantly associated with an increased  likelihood of reporting specific themes in definitions. IMPLICATIONS: As health care  professionals adapt to the changing demographic composition of society, it should be  of interest to understand what successful aging might mean to the elderly males to  whom they are attending.","2003-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:18:26","","735-744","","5","43","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 14570969","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Male; Adult; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Activities of Daily Living; Population Surveillance; Aged -- psychology; Personal Satisfaction; Aging/*psychology; *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Manitoba/epidemiology; Terminology as Topic; *Terminology as Topic; Aged/psychology/*statistics & numerical data; Manitoba -- epidemiology; Aged -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we  obtained magnetic resonance scans in 18 subjects with very mild DAT (CDR 0.5) and 26  age-matched nondemented controls (CDR 0) 2 years apart. Large-deformation  high-dimensional brain mapping was used to quantify and compare changes in  hippocampal shape as well as volume in the two groups of subjects.

We used singular-value decomposition and logistic regression  models to quantify hippocampal shape change across time within individuals, and this  shape change in the CDR 0.5 and CDR 0 subjects was found to be significantly  different (Wilks's lambda, P = 0.014). Further, at baseline, CDR 0.5 subjects, in  comparison to CDR 0 subjects, showed inward deformation over 38% of the hippocampal  surface; after 2 years this difference grew to 47%. Also, within the CDR 0 subjects,  shape change between baseline and follow-up was largely confined to the head of the  hippocampus and subiculum, while in the CDR 0.5 subjects, shape change involved the  lateral body of the hippocampus as well as the head region and subiculum.

At this old age, there are few data on fractionated lipoprotein  levels in the determination of cardiovascular disease risk. The aim of this study  was to evaluate the relationships between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and mortality from specific causes  among people in the oldest age categories. METHODS: Between September 1, 1997, and  September 1, 1999, a total of 705 inhabitants in the community of Leiden, the  Netherlands, reached the age of 85 years. Among these old people, we initiated a  prospective follow-up study to investigate determinants of successful aging. A total  of 599 subjects participated (response rate, 87%) and all were followed up to  September 2001. Serum levels of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol were assessed at  baseline along with detailed information on comorbid conditions. The main outcome  measure was all-cause and specific mortality risk. RESULTS: During 4 years of  follow-up, 152 subjects died. The leading cause of death was cardiovascular disease,  with similar mortality risks in all tertiles of LDL cholesterol level. In contrast,  low HDL cholesterol level was associated with a 2.0-fold higher risk of fatal  cardiovascular disease (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.2). The mortality risk  of coronary artery disease was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-3.9) and for stroke it was 2.6 (95%  CI, 1.0-6.6). Both low LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol concentrations were  associated with an increased mortality risk of infection: 2.7 (95% CI, 1.2-6.2) and  2.4 (95% CI, 1.1-5.6), respectively. The risks were unaffected by comorbidity.

Diseases diagnosed in  the elderly are generally not curable; if not properly treated and monitored over  time, they tend to generate complications and sequelae that impair patients'  independence and autonomy. Health is no longer measured by the presence or absence  of disease, but by the degree of preservation of functional capacity. Factors for  healthy aging with good functional capacity and those which increase the risk of  death and disability need to be identified by longitudinal surveys that include the  elderly population living in the community. This article presents data from the  first follow-up survey of senior citizens in Brasil, called the Epidoso Project  (from ""epi"" as in ""epidemiologic"" and ""idoso"" or ""elderly"" in Portuguese)  implemented since 1991 in the city of São Paulo.

The clinical performance of the individuals with DAT in these domains was compared with these predictions. RESULTS: Collateral sources were consistently and significantly accurate in reporting the cognitive capabilities of individuals with very mild and mild DAT.

This study was designed to examine longitudinally the relation between everyday  activities and indicators of successful aging, namely well-being, function, and  mortality. METHODS: The study was based on the Aging in Manitoba Study, with  activity being measured in 1990 and function, well-being, and mortality assessed in  1996. Well-being was measured in terms of life satisfaction and happiness; function  was defined in terms of a composite measure combining physical and cognitive  function. RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that greater overall activity level  was related to greater happiness, better function, and reduced mortality. Different  activities were related to different outcome measures; but generally, social and  productive activities were positively related to happiness, function, and mortality,  whereas more solitary activities (e.g., hand-work hobbies) were related only to  happiness. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the importance of activity in  successful aging. The results also suggest that different types of activities may  have different benefits. Whereas social and productive activities may afford  physical benefits, as reflected in better function and greater longevity, more  solitary activities, such as reading, may have more psychological benefits by  providing a sense of engagement with life.","2003-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:34:18","","S74-82","","2","58","","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12646596","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Sex Factors; Health Status; Longitudinal Studies; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Odds Ratio; Personal Satisfaction; Aged, 80 and Over; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; P-Value; Self Report; Aging/*psychology; *Activities of Daily Living; *Social Behavior; *Happiness; Manitoba; Regression; Interviews; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Research Instruments; Activities of Daily Living -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biological markers in body fluids, such as blood, could provide insight in  those processes. In the present studies serum concentrations of different markers  have been correlated to cognitive functioning of cognitively healthy aging  individuals over a period of six years (mean age 57 years, SD 11, n = 93). Markers  were related to mechanisms known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease, including  inflammation, cholesterol homeostasis and homocysteine homeostasis. Domains of  cognitive function addressed were cognitive speed (Letter-Digit Coding test),  attention and information processing (Stroop test), and memory (Word Learning test:  Total Words and Delayed Recall). Baseline concentrations of haptoglobine,  homocysteine, lathosterol and lanosterol were negatively correlated with cognitive  functioning on the Stroop test over the whole follow-up period of six years.  Concentrations of all markers, i.e. haptoglobine, C-reactive protein, homocysteine,  lathosterol and lanosterol, were also negatively correlated with functioning on the  Word Learning test (Delayed Recall and for some markers also with the Total Words)  over the whole six-years follow-up period. In conclusion, concentrations of serum  markers related to inflammation, homocysteine and cholesterol homeostasis are not  only associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also with cognitive functioning in the  cognitively healthy aging population.","2003-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","6-12","","1","34","","Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr","","","","","","","","dut","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands PMID: 12629905","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Cognition/*physiology; Biomarkers/blood; Aging/blood/*physiology; C-Reactive Protein/analysis; Cholesterol/blood; Cognition Disorders/*blood; Alzheimer Disease/blood; Haptoglobins/analysis; Homocysteine/blood; Lanosterol/blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three  U.S. communities. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 870 participants from the MacArthur  Studies of Successful Aging. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline information was obtained for  serum levels of cholesterol, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and albumin; body  mass index; prevalent medical conditions; health behaviors; and medications. Crude  and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association  between serum total cholesterol levels and 7-year all-cause mortality, while  adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the risk ratio  of low serum total cholesterol level (<169 mg/dL) for 7-year total mortality was  1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-3.07). The multiple adjusted risk ratios  were 1.82 (95% CI = 1.10-3.00) after controlling for markers of inflammation and  nutrition and 1.39 (95% CI = 0.80-2.40) after adjustment for additional  cardiovascular risk factors. Sex was an important confounding variable that  contributed to the observed inverse association between low serum cholesterol and  overall mortality in univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocholesterolemia is not an  independent risk factor for increased overall mortality in high-functioning  community-dwelling older men and women. The association between low total  cholesterol and high mortality observed in crude analysis is mainly confounded by  common cardiovascular risk factors, rather than underlying inflammation or  undernutrition.","2003-01","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 22:47:57","","80-84","","1","51","","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 12534850","","","","Aged; Humans; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Geriatric Assessment; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Logistic Models; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Checklists; Funding Source; Human; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; T-Tests; Univariate Statistics; Aging -- Physiology; aging; Cause of Death; *Health Status; inflammation; malnutrition; mortality; Cholesterol/*blood; Epidemiologic Studies; Inflammation/*mortality; Nutrition Disorders/blood/*mortality; Serum Albumin/*deficiency; Geriatric Nutrition; Research Instruments; Interleukins -- Blood; C-Reactive Protein -- Blood; Cholesterol -- Blood -- In Old Age; Inflammation -- In Old Age; Nutrition Disorders -- In Old Age; serum total cholesterol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: The percentage of those rating themselves as aging successfully was 50.3%  compared with 18.8% classified according to Rowe and Kahn's criteria. Although  absence of chronic conditions and maintaining functioning were positively associated  with successful aging for both definitions, many participants with chronic  conditions and with functional difficulties still rated themselves as aging  successfully; none were so classified according to Rowe and Kahn's criteria.

The children of long-lived parents  may therefore age more successfully than the children of short-lived parents.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used three major cross-sectional, population-based surveys  to study the association of parental longevity with successful ageing in offspring.  The measures of ageing were hand-grip strength, cognitive performance (mini mental  state examination (MMSE) and a cognitive composite score), self-reported diseases,  and self-rated health. RESULTS: For every additional ten years the parents lived,  grip strength increased by 0.32 kg (95% CI = 0.00-0.63), the MMSE score by 0.20  points (95% CI = 0.03-0.37), and cognitive composite score by 0.24 points (95% CI =  0.07-0.40). A ten-year increment of parental life was associated with a reduction by  approximately 0.20 in the adjusted OR for having each of the following conditions:  diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, or fair,  poor or very poor self-rated health. Almost all the effects were seen solely in the  cohort of 70+ year-olds, but not in the middle-aged or nonagenarians.

METHODS: Clock drawings were  obtained during the initial clinical assessments of 75 participants in a  longitudinal study of healthy aging and dementia of the Alzheimer type (15  cognitively normal, 25 with very mild dementia, 21 with mild dementia, and 14 with  moderate to severe dementia, as staged by the Clinical Dementia Rating). Each clock  drawing later was judged blindly and independently by two raters according to six  commonly used sets of scoring criteria. RESULTS: The same pattern of results was  obtained for all six scoring methods. Inter-rater reliability was consistently high.  Spearman correlations indicated that as dementia severity increased, clock drawing  performance decreased. Analyses of variance revealed that although those with mild  or moderate/severe dementia performed significantly worse on the clock drawing test  than did individuals who had very mild dementia or who were cognitively normal, the  latter two groups did not differ significantly. Sensitivity and specificity analyses  revealed that all methods could distinguish between normal aging and dementia of at  least mild severity. However, sensitivity for detecting very mild dementia was poor.

METHODS: A prospective cohort  study of 779 high-functioning men and women aged 70 to 79 from the MacArthur Study  of Successful Aging was conducted. Regression modeling was used to investigate  whether baseline IL-6 levels (classified by tertiles) were associated with initial  cognitive function and whether IL-6 levels predicted subsequent declines in  cognitive function from 1988 to 1991 (2.5-year follow-up) and from 1988 to 1995  (7-year follow-up). RESULTS: Subjects in the highest tertile for plasma IL-6 were  marginally more likely to exhibit poorer baseline cognitive function (i.e., scores  below the median), independent of demographic status, social status, health and  health behaviors, and other physiologic variables (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46; 95% CI:  0.97, 2.20).

MacArthur studies of successful aging.","Journal of clinical epidemiology","","0895-4356","10.1016/s0895-4356(02)00399-2","","Allostatic load has been proposed as a cumulative measure of dysregulation across multiple physiological systems, and has been postulated to impact health risks. In the allostatic load model, increased risk is hypothesized to result not only from large and clinically significant dysregulation in individual systems, but also from more modest dysregulation, if present in multiple systems. Our objective was to construct an allostatic load score by optimally combining several physiologic measurements, and to examine its association with future functional decline. We analyzed data from a 7-year longitudinal study of a community-based cohort, whose age at baseline was between 70 and 79 years. Canonical correlation analysis was used to study the association of 10 biological measurements representing allostatic load with declines in scores on five tests each of physical and cognitive function over two follow-up periods: 1998-1991 and 1991-1995. We used bootstrapping to evaluate the stability of the canonical correlation and canonical weights. The canonical correlation between allostatic load and the 20 decline scores was 0.43 (P =.03) and the [25th, 75th] percentile interval of its distribution over 200 bootstrapped subsamples of the cohort was [0.48, 0.53]. These findings were not substantially affected by adjusting for covariates and cardiovascular disease.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Durham, North Carolina; East Boston, Massachusetts;  and New Haven, Connecticut, areas that are part of the National Institute on Aging  Established Populations for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly. PARTICIPANTS:  Participants, aged 70 to 79, from three community-based studies, who were in the top  third of this age group, based on physical and cognitive functional status.  MEASUREMENTS: New onset of cognitive impairment as defined by a score of less than 7  on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) in 1995. RESULTS: At 7  years, 21.8% (149 of 684 subjects) scored lower than 7 on the SPMSQ. Using  multivariate logistic regression, three baseline (1988) cognitive tests predicted  impairment in 1995. These included two simple tests of delayed recall-the ability to  remember up to six items from a short story and up to 18 words from recall of Boston  Naming Test items. For each story item missed, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for  cognitive impairment was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.16-1.78, P <.001).  For each missed item from the word list, the AOR was 1.20 (95% CI = 1.09-1.31, P  <.001). The Delayed Recognition Span, which assesses nonverbal memory, also  predicted cognitive impairment, albeit less strongly (odds ratio = 1.06 per each  missed answer, 95% CI = 1.003-1.13, P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies  measures of delayed recall and recognition as significant early predictors of  subsequent cognitive decline in high-functioning older persons.

Premature deaths, childhood variables, and alcohol abuse have  been often ignored. So has positive aging. As people live longer, gerontology needs  to understand the determinants of health as well as illness in the later years.  METHOD: The present study follows a cohort of adolescent boys (332 inner-city  youths) for 60 years or until death. Complete physical exams were obtained every 5  years and psychosocial data every 2 years. Predictor variables assessed prior to age  50 include six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors--parental social class,  environmental strengths, number of family problems, major depression, ancestral  longevity, and premorbid physical health at age 50--and six variables reflecting (at  least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, body mass  index, coping mechanisms, and education. The four outcome variables chosen to assess  healthy aging at 70 reflected both ""mind"" and ""body."" They included objectively  assessed variables (death and/or disability prior to 70, and objective mental  health) and two subjectively assessed variables (perceived instrumental activities  of daily living and life enjoyment). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that  positive aging at 70 could be predicted by variables assessed prior to age 50. More  hopeful still, if the six variables under some personal control were controlled,  depression was the only uncontrollable variable that affected the quality of  subjective and objective aging. CONCLUSIONS: First, we may have greater personal  control over our biopsychosocial health after retirement than previously recognized.  Second, in this cohort, psychiatric rather than sociological predictors appeared  more important.","2001-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:04:14","","425-437","","4","13","","Int Psychogeriatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 12003249","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Male; Aging; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; Internal-External Control; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Odds Ratio; Urban Population; Urban Health; Personal Satisfaction; Family; Life Change Events; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; Aging/*psychology; *Urban Population; Intelligence Tests; Coping; Middle Age; Adolescence; Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; Interviews; Mental Health -- In Old Age; Logistic Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because aging decreases the ability to learn new information while preserving more established knowledge, this article examines whether the association between change in cognitive and physical performance depends on the nature of the physical task.Methods: Data from the MacArthur Research Network on Successful Aging Community Study--a longitudinal three-site, cohort study of high-functioning, disability-free Americans aged 70 to 79 in 1988 (reinterviewed in 1991 and 1995)--are used for this investigation. We examine the association between change in cognitive performance and two categories of physical performance: novel/attentional demanding physical tasks (e.g., standing on a single leg) or routine physical tasks (e.g., walking at a normal pace). Change in physical performance (over 7 years) is regressed on change in cognitive performance (over the same period) controlling for baseline cognitive ability, demographic factors, health status, and behavioral characteristics.Results: The findings suggest that declines in cognitive performance are associated with declines in both novel/attentional demanding and routine physical tasks. In addition to decline in cognition, gender, prevalent health conditions (e.g., cancer, high blood pressure, and the fracture of a hip), and smoking behavior are associated with decline in performance on some physical tasks.Conclusions: The findings suggest that the successful execution of physical tasks demands cognitive processes regardless of the nature of the task. Researchers using performance-based measures of physical functioning should pay particular attention to the cognitive capacities of their subjects and how these might influence their assessment.","2002-04","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:34:04","","M228-235","","4","57","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11909888","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Aging -- psychology; Cognition; Physical Fitness; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; *Cognition; Attention; Aging/*physiology/*psychology; *Physical Fitness; Intelligence Tests; Motor Activity; Behavior; Data Analysis Software; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Data Analysis, Statistical; Multiple Linear Regression; Cognition -- In Old Age; Research Instruments; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is controversial  whether high serum uric acid level is a true independent risk factor for  cardiovascular and total mortality or the association is due to other confounding  variables. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the predictive value of uric acid  level on mortality observed in younger cohorts can be extended to older people.  DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A sample of community-dwelling older  people. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of 870 participants from the MacArthur Studies of  Successful Aging. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline information was obtained for serum uric  acid level, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prevalent medical  conditions, and health behaviors. Crude and multivariate logistic regression  analyses were used to examine the association between serum uric acid levels and  7-year all-cause mortality, while adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: In  men, the multiply adjusted risk ratios for 7-year total mortality were 1.07 (95%  CI=0.61-1.88) for the mid tertile of uric acid level and 1.24 (95% CI=0.70-2.20) for  the top tertile. In women, the multiply adjusted risk ratios were 0.58 (95%  CI=0.29-1.18) and 0.47 (95% CI=0.22-0.99), for the mid and top tertiles  respectively. CRP and IL-6 were important confounders in the relationship between  serum uric acid and overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: High serum uric acid level is  not independently associated with increased total mortality in high-functioning  older men and women. When evaluating the association between serum uric acid and  mortality, the potential confounding effect of underlying inflammation and other  risk factors must be considered.","2001-12","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:45:59","","1679-1684","","12","49","","J Am Geriatr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11844003","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Cause of Death; inflammation; *Life Style; Aging/*physiology; *Cause of Death; Residence Characteristics; mortality; aged; Uric Acid/*blood; Cardiovascular Diseases/*blood/etiology/*mortality; 268B43MJ25; Uric Acid; Cardiovascular Diseases -- mortality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- etiology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- blood; Uric Acid -- blood; serum uric acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the relationship between phosphorylated tau lesions and cognitive function in 31 persons participating in the Religious Orders Study, a prospective, longitudinal clinicopathological study of aging and Alzheimer's disease. All subjects underwent detailed neuropsychological performance testing within a year of death and evidenced a spectrum of cognitive performance ranging from normal abilities to mild dementia. Measures of neurofibrillary tangle density and phosphorylated tau immunoreactive structures (predominantly neuropil threads) in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices by quantitative image analysis were significantly correlated (r = 0.5). In multiple linear regression analyses controlling for age, sex, and education, parahippocampal neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads were significantly lower in persons without cognitive impairment compared to those with mild cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's disease. Further, neurofibrillary tangles were significantly correlated to measures of episodic memory but not other cognitive abilities; neuropil tangles were not significantly related to memory or other cognitive functions. These data indicate that phosphorylated tau pathology in the ventromedial temporal lobe develop prior to the onset of clinical dementia and their presence is associated with cognitive impairment, particularly impairment of episodic memory.","2002-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-19 00:23:28","","182-189","","2","51","","Ann Neurol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11835374","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Linear Models; Aging/*pathology; Alzheimer Disease/mortality/*pathology; Cognition Disorders/mortality/*pathology; Neurofibrillary Tangles/chemistry/pathology; Parahippocampal Gyrus/*pathology; tau Proteins/*analysis/metabolism; Linear Regression; Alzheimer's Disease -- Pathology; Temporal Lobe -- Pathology; Alzheimer's Disease -- Mortality; Cognition Disorders -- Mortality; Cognition Disorders -- Pathology; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Analysis; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Metabolism; Neurons; Neurons -- Pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Data were collected at the four  Cardiovascular Health Study field centers. PARTICIPANTS: 5,888 participants age 65  years and older in the Cardiovascular Health Study. MEASUREMENTS: Presence of  chronic disease was assessed at baseline and over a maximum 7-year follow-up period.  Participants who were free of chronic disease (no cardiovascular disease (CVD),  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or self-reported cancer, except nonmelanoma  skin cancer) at the baseline examination were then monitored for the onset of  incident cancer, cardiovascular disease, and fatal outcomes. RESULTS: A high  proportion of these older adults was healthy at the initial examination and remained  healthy over the follow-up period. Numerous behavioral factors were associated with  continued health, including physical activity, refraining from cigarette smoking,  wine consumption (women), higher educational status, and lower waist circumference.  A number of CVD risk factors and subclinical disease measures were associated with  continued health, including higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, lack  of diabetes, thinner common carotid intimal nmedial thickness, lower blood pressure,  lower C-reactive protein, and higher ankle-arm blood pressure ratio. Among the  behavioral factors, exercise, not smoking, and not taking aspirin remained  significant predictors of health even after controlling for CVD risk factors and  subclinical disease in older adults.

The International Collaborative  Study for Oral Health Outcomes provides a data set for exploring the oral health of  a diverse sample of older adults in US and international sites using the modified  Andersen Behavioral Model. The percent of adults who report no natural teeth ranged  from 16 percent in San Antonio to 59 percent in New Zealand. Seventy percent or more  of the adults from each site rated their oral health as good/fair or better except  in Poland. The current cohort of older adults is faring better on some indicators  than others; nevertheless, ethnic minorities and poorer countries still demonstrate  inequities.

This represents a major paradigm shift in the field from a focus on declines in physical and social functioning, assumptions of the aging process as a downward spiral, and studies on how to manage these declines. Leading the way toward this new perspective on aging, the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging asked the fundamental question: ""What genetic, biomedical, behavioral, and social factors are crucial to maintaining health and functional capacities in the later years?"" These studies examined longitudinally a large cohort of independent elders on several physical, cognitive, emotional, and social parameters. Other researchers have focused on the theme of robust aging; however, common predictors have emerged, such as remaining active physically and cognitively, maintaining social contacts, and avoiding disease. This research is timely, given the expanding population of the oldest old, and with successive cohorts demonstrating the ""compression of morbidity"" phenomenon. Such a paradigm shift is critical in geriatric dentistry as well, where successful aging is evident in the growing number of older adults who have retained their natural dentition into advanced old age. This presentation draws parallels between successful aging at the systemic and oral health levels, with illustrations from epidemiologic studies that demonstrate trends in improved health and quality of life among newer cohorts of older adults.","2000","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:49:05","","276-281","","4","60","","J Public Health Dent","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11243047","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Health; Female; Male; Social Environment; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Dentistry; Educational Status; Emotions; Forecasting; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Morbidity; Motor Activity -- physiology; Oral Health; Population Dynamics; Quality of Life; Socioeconomic Factors; *Oral Health; Cognition/physiology; Aging/*physiology; Motor Activity/physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The predictive value of high urinary catecholamine excretion for functional decline and mortality in healthier older persons has not been determined.Subjects and Methods: We used data from the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging to determine the effects of high urinary catecholamine excretion on 3- and 7-year mortality and functional decline. In 1988, 765 high-functioning older subjects provided complete overnight urine samples for norepinephrine and epinephrine, and 199 of these provided repeat samples in 1991. Subjects who were in the top tertile of urinary norepinephrine or epinephrine excretion in 1988 were considered high excreters; those in the top tertile in both 1988 and 1991 were considered sustained high excreters. We used bivariate and multivariate analysis to examine the relations between high catecholamine excretion and mortality and Rosow-Breslau functional decline in 1991 and 1995.Results: In multivariate analyses, subjects with high baseline urinary excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or either catecholamine were at higher risk for mortality and functional decline at 3 and 7 years, although the magnitude of risk (adjusted odds-ratios ranged from 1.1 to 3.1) varied depending upon specific catecholamine and outcome measure. Subjects who had sustained high urinary norepinephrine excretion were also at increased risk for 4-year mortality or functional decline.Conclusions: High urinary catecholamine excretion in high-functioning, community-dwelling older persons likely reflects subclinical sympathetic stimulation and is a marker of increased risk for functional decline and mortality.","2000-10","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:07:13","","M618-624","","10","55","","J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 11034236","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aging; Cohort Studies; Forecasting; Longevity; Prospective Studies; Odds Ratio; Aging -- urine; Epinephrine; Epinephrine -- urine; Multivariate Analysis; Norepinephrine; Norepinephrine -- urine; Osmolar Concentration; X4W3ENH1CV; YKH834O4BH; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; *Longevity; Epinephrine/*urine; Aging/*urine; Norepinephrine/*urine; Clinical Assessment Tools; Epinephrine -- Urine; Norepinephrine -- Urine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

M.","The relationship between longitudinal declines in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations and cognitive performance in older men.","Archives of internal medicine","","0003-9926","10.1001/archinte.160.14.2193","","BACKGROUND: The observation that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations decrease markedly with age has led to the hypothesis that declining DHEA  concentrations may contribute to age-related changes in cognition. In the United  States, DHEA is widely available as an over-the-counter supplement that individuals  are using in an effort to ameliorate age-related cognitive and physical changes.  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between age-associated decreases in  endogenous DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) concentrations and declines in neuropsychological  performance in a prospective, longitudinal study. METHODS: The subjects were 883 men  from a community-dwelling volunteer sample in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of  Aging. The men were aged 22 to 91 years at the initial visit, and they were followed  up for as long as 31 years (mean, 11. 55 years), with biennial reassessments of  multiple cognitive domains and contemporaneous measurement of serum DHEA-S  concentrations. Outcome measures were the results of cognitive tests of verbal and  visual memory, 2 tests of mental status, phonemic and semantic word fluency tests,  and measures of visuomotor scanning and attention. Serum DHEA-S concentrations were  determined by standard radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Neither the rates of decline in  mean DHEA-S concentrations nor the mean DHEA-S concentrations within individuals  were related to cognitive status or cognitive decline. A comparison between the  highest and lowest DHEA-S quartiles revealed no cognitive differences, despite the  fact that these groups differed in endogenous DHEA-S concentration by more than a  factor of 4 for a mean duration of 12 years. CONCLUSION: Our longitudinal results  augment those of previous prospective studies by suggesting that the decline in  endogenous DHEA-S concentration is independent of cognitive status and cognitive  decline in healthy aging men.","2000-07-24","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","2193-2198","","14","160","","Arch Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10904463","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Reference Values; Prospective Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Psychological Tests; Cognition/*physiology; Biomarkers/blood; Aging/*blood; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/*blood; *Psychomotor Performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elderly people have less muscle and bone mass,  expanded extracellular fluid volumes, and reduced body cell mass compared to younger  adults. These nonfat components of body composition play critical roles, influencing  cognitive and physical functional status, nutritional and endocrine status, quality  of life, and comorbidity in elderly people. Different patterns of ""disordered body  composition"" have different relationships to these outcomes and may require  different, tailored approaches to treatment that combine various exercise regimens  and dietary supplements with hormone replacement or appetite-stimulating drugs.  Skeletal muscle atrophy, or ""sarcopenia,"" is highly prevalent in the elderly  population, increases with age, and is strongly associated with disability,  independent of morbidity. Elders at greatest risk are those who are simultaneously  sarcopenic and obese. The accurate identification of sarcopenic obesity requires  precise methods of simultaneously measuring fat and lean components, such as  dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.","2000-05","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","437-448","","","904","","Ann N Y Acad Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: United States PMID: 10865787","","","","Aged; Humans; Female; Male; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Quality of Life; Prevalence; Reference Values; Activities of Daily Living; Body Weight; Bone Density; New Mexico; Aging/*physiology; Body Composition/*physiology; Absorptiometry, Photon/methods; Obesity/physiopathology; Adipose Tissue/anatomy & histology; Muscle, Skeletal/anatomy & histology; Muscular Atrophy/epidemiology/physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: We studied the nutritional intake of 96 elderly persons who  had met criteria of good health status in 1993 at a four-year interval. The  nutritional intake of the elderly subjects who remained healthy during the four-year  interval (18 men and 64 women), was considered to globally correspond to their  nutritional needs. The nutritional intake was evaluated by a three-day food record.  RESULTS: The mean baseline weight of the subjects who remained in good health during  the four years was 72,6 +/- 9,5 kg for men and 60,1 +/- 9,3 kg for women. In four  years, mean weight remained globally stable. But in cross-sectional analysis, weight  tended to decrease with the age of the subjects. This decrease was significant for  women in 1993. Mean baseline intake was nearly 29 kcal/kg. Longitudinal and  cross-sectional analyses showed that it changed only slightly with age. Though  global energy intake varied slighlty in four years, we have observed some changes in  the composition of this caloric intake. For men and women, protein intake tended to  decrease in four years (respectively -0,4% and -0,6%), carbohydrate intake to  decrease (respectively -1,1% and -2,7%) and fat intake to increase (respectively  +2,1% and +2,9%). These variations were not significant except for fat and  carbohydrate intakes in women. In 1993, for a majority of subjects, the intakes of  iron, and vitamins C and B12 were higher and the intakes of calcium, zinc, vitamins  A, B1, B6 and B9 were lower than the French recommendations. In four years, mean  intake did not change significantly, except for calcium intake in women (-8,8%).  CONCLUSION: In this study, healthy aging was associated with a mean caloric intake  close to 29 kcal/kg which is near the upper limits of recommendations (between 25  and 30 kcal/kg/d). These intakes, like those of macronutrients and micronutrients  changed little with advancing age. These results suggest that the needs of the  elderly remain quite stable with aging. Nevertheless a tendency to weight loss with  aging is observed, especially in older subjects, suggesting that even if food intake  contributes to the maintenance of healthy aging, aging processes are  multidimensional and frailty that is often associated with weight loss is  ineluctable for older subjects.","2000","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-16 22:44:53","","77-80","","2","4","","J Nutr Health Aging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: France PMID: 10842418","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Energy Intake; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet Records; Energy Metabolism; Follow-Up Studies; France; Nutritional Status; Sex Factors; *Geriatric Assessment; Aging/*physiology; Diet/*standards; *Eating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS: 762 men and  women, aged 70 to 79 at baseline, who were part of the MacArthur Study of Successful  Aging. DESIGN: A longitudinal case-cohort: those with prevalent fractures at  baseline were excluded; cases were persons with a medically diagnosed hip, arm,  spine, or wrist fracture during the follow-up period (1988-1995). MEASURES: Eight  physical performance tests: turning a circle, walking fast, chair stands, timed tap,  tandem stand, grip strength, single leg stand, and balance (average of single leg  and tandem stands) measured at baseline and follow-up. ANALYSIS: Two fracture groups  were defined: (1) those with incident wrist fractures (n = 7) and (2) those with a  fracture of the hip, arm, or spine (combined fractures group, n = 16). Change in  physical performance was analyzed using crude, age-adjusted, and multiply-adjusted  ANCOVA models.

DESIGN: a longitudinal, community-based study.  SETTING: Dubbo, New South Wales, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 2805 men and women 60  years and older, first examined in 1988-89. OUTCOME MEASURES: activities of daily  living assessed serially every 2 years over 8 years (scored in the range 0-6, least  to most impaired); scores related to subsequent hospital admissions and to  demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics at baseline. RESULTS: 1973  men and women provided complete follow-up data. Mean disability score at entry was  low at 0.18 and increased to 0.69 by the final survey. Those having three or more  hospital admissions (40% of the sample) had minimum disability (disability score  approximately 0.3) around 5 years earlier than those with fewer admissions. Those  with dementia or other mental illness had the most severe disability (mean  disability scores of 3.15 and 2.13 respectively), but their numbers were very small.  Those with a stroke or respiratory illness were more numerous and they had major  physical disability (mean disability scores of 1.44 and 1.32 respectively). In a  regression model, the statistically significant baseline predictors of disability at  the final survey were age, body mass index, use of anti-hypertensive medication,  history of stroke, depression score, peak expiratory flow and physical disability.  CONCLUSIONS: the findings confirm reduced or delayed disability in older citizens  requiring little or no hospitalization. Age, impaired peak expiratory flow and  physical disability at study entry were most strongly predictive of disability,  while stroke and respiratory illness were relatively common causes of severe  disability.","2000-03","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 23:01:52","","143-148","","2","29","","Age Ageing","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","","","Place: England PMID: 10791449","","","","Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Aged, 80 and over; Follow-Up Studies; Prospective Studies; Regression Analysis; Age Factors; Australia; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; *Health Status; Aging/*physiology; Age of Onset; *Disability Evaluation; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Coefficient Alpha; Data Analysis Software; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Multiple Linear Regression; Activities of Daily Living -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Gerontologic Care -- Australia; Internal Consistency; Smoking -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is likely due to a combination of viral factors, gender differences, hormonal imbalance and psychosocial and structural conditions. This interdisciplinary cohort study aims to understand how biological, clinical and sociostructural determinants of health interact to modulate healthy ageing in WLWH.METHODS AND ANALYSISThe British Columbia Children and Women: AntiRetroviral therapy and Markers of Aging-Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CARMA-CHIWOS) Collaboration (BCC3) study will enrol WLWH (n=350) and sociodemographically matched HIV-negative women (n=350) living in British Columbia. A subset of BCC3 participants will be past participants of CARMA, n≥1000 women and children living with and without HIV, 2008-2018 and/or CHIWOS, n=1422 WLWH, 2013-2018. Over two study visits, we will collect biological specimens for virus serologies, hormones and biological markers as well as administer a survey capturing demographic and sociostructural-behavioural factors. Sociodemographics, comorbidities, number and type of chronic/latent viral infections and hormonal irregularities will be compared between the two groups. Their association with biological markers and psychostructural and sociostructural factors will be investigated through multivariable regression and structural equation modelling. Retrospective longitudinal analyses will be conducted on data from past CARMA/CHIWOS participants. As BCC3 aims to follow participants as they age, this protocol will focus on the first study visits.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATIONThis study has been approved by the University of British Columbia Children's and Women's Research Ethics Board (H19-00896). Results will be shared in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and at community events as well as at www.hivhearme.ca and @HIV_HEAR_me.

A total of eight evaluators performed marker placements on five participants on three different days. Evaluators placed markers bilaterally on specific anatomical locations of the pelvis, thigh, shank and foot. On the right foot, markers were placed in anatomical locations to define a multi-segmental foot model. The position of the marker at the anatomical locations was recorded by a motion capture system. The reliability and objectivity of lower limb segment lengths was determined by the intraclass correlation coefficient of a two-way random model and of the two-way mixed model, respectively. For all evaluators for all segments, the average reliability and objectivity was greater than 0.8, except for the metatarsus segment (0.683).

In the present study, we demonstrate that, starting in mid-to-late adulthood, gut microbiomes become increasingly unique to individuals with age. We leverage three independent cohorts comprising over 9,000 individuals and find that compositional uniqueness is strongly associated with microbially produced amino acid derivatives circulating in the bloodstream. In older age (over ~80 years), healthy individuals show continued microbial drift towards a unique compositional state, whereas this drift is absent in less healthy individuals. The identified microbiome pattern of healthy ageing is characterized by a depletion of core genera found across most humans, primarily Bacteroides. Retaining a high Bacteroides dominance into older age, or having a low gut microbiome uniqueness measure, predicts decreased survival in a 4-year follow-up. Our analysis identifies increasing compositional uniqueness of the gut microbiome as a component of healthy ageing, which is characterized by distinct microbial metabolic outputs in the blood.","2021-02","2021-08-16 23:14:15","2021-08-16 23:14:15","","274-286","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","2492661490; 33619379","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Predictive Value of Tests; Young Adult; Metabolomics; Survival Analysis; Amino Acids; Amino Acids -- blood; Bacteroides -- metabolism; Gastrointestinal Microbiome -- physiology; Healthy Aging -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After decades of research focused on extending lifespan, current efforts seek primarily to promote healthy aging. Recent advances suggest that biological processes linked to aging are more reliable than chronological age to account for an individual's functional status, i.e. frail or robust. It is becoming increasingly apparent that biological aging may be detectable as a progressive loss of resilience much earlier than the appearance of clinical signs of frailty. In this context, the INSPIRE program was built to identify the mechanisms of accelerated aging and the early biological signs predicting frailty and pathological aging. To address this issue, we designed a cohort of outbred Swiss mice (1576 male and female mice) in which we will continuously monitor spontaneous and voluntary physical activity from 6 to 24 months of age under either normal or high fat/high sucrose diet. At different age points (6, 12, 18, 24 months), multiorgan functional phenotyping will be carried out to identify early signs of organ dysfunction and generate a large biological fluids/feces/organs biobank (100,000 samples). A comprehensive correlation between functional and biological phenotypes will be assessed to determine: 1) the early signs of biological aging and their relationship with chronological age; 2) the role of dietary and exercise interventions on accelerating or decelerating the rate of biological aging; and 3) novel targets for the promotion of healthy aging. All the functional and omics data, as well as the biobank generated in the framework of the INSPIRE cohort will be available to the aging scientific community.

Given the unprecedented shift in the average age of Canadians over the next half century, it will be important to investigate the determinants of lung function in the elderly. In the following study, we estimated the association between lung function and a broad array of factors related to sociodemographics, lifestyle, chronic medical conditions and psychosocial factors in older adults aged 45-86 years old using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 21,338). In addition to examining the entire cohort, we also performed stratified analyses within men/women, adults aged 45-64/65+, and healthy/comorbid. In multivariable regression, our explanatory factors (excluding age, sex, height and ethnicity) were able to explain 17% and 11% of the total variance in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, respectively. Notable and significant contributions were observed for respiratory disease, smoking, obesity, income, and physical activity, while psychosocial factors mainly exhibited non-significant associations. Generally, these associations were stronger for males than females, and adults 65 and older as compared to those aged 45-64. Our findings indicate that there are pervasive and generally under-recognized sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that exhibit significant associations with FEV1 and FEV1/FVC in older adults. While implication of causality in these relationships is not possible due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, future work aiming to investigate determinants of lung health in older adults may choose to target these factors, given that many are modifiable.","2020-11","2021-08-16 23:14:16","2021-08-16 23:14:16","","106157","","","173","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","2448408134; 33010732","","","","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sex Factors; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Age Factors; Smoking; Canada; Income; Healthy Aging -- physiology; Determinants; Forced Expiratory Volume; Lung -- physiology; Lung function; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Sex; Spirometry; Vital Capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was designed to investigate this relationship in Chinese oldest-old population.MethodsThe China Hainan Centenarian Cohort Study was performed in 18 cities and counties of Hainan. A total of 1,226 females, including 758 centenarian women and 468 women aged 80-99 years, were enrolled in this study. Using a standardized protocol, in-person interviews and blood analyses were conducted by a well-trained research team through home visits.ResultsCentenarian women had significantly lower number of children (NOC) and higher initial childbearing age (ICA) and last childbearing age (LCA) than women aged 80-99 years (p < 0.05 for all). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NOC and testosterone (T) levels were positively associated with women aged 80-99 years, when centenarian women was considered as reference (p < 0.05 for all). ICA, LCA, and estradiol (E2) levels were negatively associated with women aged 80-99 years, when centenarian women was considered as reference (p < 0.05 for all).ConclusionsThe centenarians had crucial characteristics of less and delayed childbearing, indicating a negative relationship between female fertility and longevity in Chinese oldest-old population. Serum E2 levels were positively associated and serum T levels were negatively associated with longevity. The less and late childbearing might be a significant factor of longevity, and successful aging might be promoted by reducing and delaying female childbearing.","2020","2021-08-16 23:14:19","2021-08-16 23:14:19","","616207","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","2492279385; 33613452","","","","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Longevity -- physiology; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cohort Studies; Aging -- blood; 3XMK78S47O; 4TI98Z838E; Estradiol; Estradiol -- blood; Testosterone; Testosterone -- blood; longevity; China -- epidemiology; centenarian; female fertility; Fertility -- physiology; negative relationship; oldest-old population; Reproductive Behavior -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article aims to present this new tool and to presents its innovative implementation at the Toulouse University Hospital through the INSPIRE study. We believe that the ICOPE integrated care program will also be a pragmatic way to maintain cognitive functions and detect early Alzheimer.OBJECTIVESThe main objective of the INSPIRE study is to build a Bio-resource Research Platform for Healthy Ageing gathering biological, clinical and digital resources in order to identify markers of ageing, age-related diseases and IC evolution. The study will be also testing the implementation and follow up of the ICOPE tool.METHODSThe Inspire Platform will gather clinical data and bio-specimens from 1000 subjects in the Occitania Region, of different ages (from 30 years and over) over 10 years. Data will be collected annually. Using the ICOPE tool IC domains will be monitored every 4 months. Once IC decline is identified, participants will have a thorough clinical assessment and blood sampling to investigate the response of markers of ageing at the time of decline. The French ethic committee approved the study.RESULTSThe Inspire platform aims to develop an integrative approach to promote novel new technologies for the assessment and monitoring of functional capacities.","2020","2021-08-16 23:14:19","2021-08-16 23:14:19","","70-74","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","2385707797; 32236394","","","","","","","Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Cohort Studies; Global Health; Patient-Centered Care -- organization & administration; intrinsic capacity; primary care; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated -- organization & administration; Geriatrics -- standards; Integrated care; person-centred assessment; Primary Health Care -- organization & administration; World Health Organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To create this index, we employed items of functional ability and intrinsic capacity. The current study aims to establish the predictive validity and discrimination properties of this healthy ageing index in settings in Latin American, part of the 10/66 cohort.METHODSPopulation-based cohort studies including 12,865 people ≥65 years old in catchment areas of Cuba, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico and Peru. We employed latent variable modelling to estimate the healthy ageing scores of each participant. We grouped participants according to the quintiles of the healthy ageing score distribution. Cox's proportional hazard models for mortality and sub-hazard (competing risks) models for incident dependence (i.e. needing care) were calculated per area after a median of 3.9 years and 3.7 years, respectively. Results were pooled together via fixed-effects meta-analysis. Our findings were compared with those obtained from self-rated health.RESULTSParticipants with lowest levels, compared to participants with highest level of healthy ageing, had increased risk of mortality and incident dependence, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions (HR: 3.25, 95%CI: 2.63-4.02; sub-HR: 5.21, 95%CI: 4.02-6.75). Healthy ageing scores compared to self-rated health had higher population attributable fractions (PAFs) for mortality (43.6% vs 19.3%) and incident dependence (58.6% vs 17.0%), and better discriminative power (Harrell's c-statistic: mortality 0.74 vs 0.72; incident dependence 0.76 vs 0.70).CONCLUSIONThese results provide evidence that our healthy ageing index could be a valuable tool for prevention strategies as it demonstrated predictive and discriminative properties.

First, we conducted whole exome sequencing in three multigenerational cancer families ascertained through a sarcoma proband (n = 19) in order to prioritize candidate genes for validation in an independent case-control cohort of sarcoma patients using family-based association and segregation analysis. The second stage employed a burden analysis of rare variants within prioritized candidate genes identified from stage one in 560 sarcoma cases and 1144 healthy ageing controls, for which whole genome sequence was available.RESULTSVariants from eight genes were identified in stage one. Following gene-based burden testing and after correction for multiple testing, two of these genes, ABCB5 and C16orf96, were determined to show statistically significant association with cancer. The ABCB5 gene was found to have a higher burden of putative regulatory variants (OR = 4.9, p-value = 0.007, q-value = 0.04) based on allele counts in sarcoma cases compared to controls. C16orf96, was found to have a significantly lower burden (OR = 0.58, p-value = 0.0004, q-value = 0.003) of regulatory variants in controls compared to sarcoma cases.CONCLUSIONSBased on these genetic association data we propose that ABCB5 and C16orf96 are novel candidate risk genes for sarcoma. Although neither of these two genes have been previously associated with sarcoma, ABCB5 has been shown to share clinical drug resistance associations with melanoma and leukaemia and C16orf96 shares regulatory elements with genes that are involved with TNF-alpha mediated apoptosis in a p53/TP53-dependent manner. Future genetic studies in other family and population cohorts will be required for further validation of these novel findings.","2019-05-03","2021-08-16 23:14:21","2021-08-16 23:14:21","","69","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","2229238932; 31053105","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Female; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Alleles; Young Adult; Pedigree; 9007-49-2; DNA; DNA -- genetics; Cancer cluster families; Genetic risk variants; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Sarcoma; Sarcoma -- genetics; Whole exome sequencing; Whole genome sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physical activity levels were estimated in minutes per week across three domains&mdash;work, leisure and transport. We created three outcome variables: low MPA (<150 min per week of MPA), low VPA (<75 min per week of VPA) and insufficient physical activity (IPA: <150 min per week of total physical activity) and applied sample-weighted multivariable logistic regression to assess associations with potential socio-demographic determinants. Prevalence of IPA, low MPA and low VPA were 25%, 26% and 65% respectively. IPA and low MPA were correlated (Spearman R = 0.98; p < 0.001). Work, leisure and transport contributed 54%, 25% and 21% to total physical activity respectively. IPA and low VPA were significantly associated with female sex, lower education, non-manual occupation and frequent fruit consumption. We observed significant differences by sex (Pheterogeneity < 0.001), on the associations between education and IPA, and between age, occupation and low VPA. In conclusion, low levels of VPA, which were more pronounced in women, support the monitoring and promotion of VPA alongside overall physical activity.

We see evidence of up to 60% of age effects on transcription levels shared across tissues, and 47% of those on splicing. Using gene expression variance and discordance between genetically identical MZ twin pairs, we identify 137 genes with age-related changes in variance and 42 genes with age-related discordance between co-twins; implying the latter are driven by environmental effects. We identify four eQTLs whose effect on expression is age-dependent (FDR 5%). Combined, these results show a complicated mix of environmental and genetically driven changes in expression with age.

Nonpenetrance, the detection of PVs in the absence of disease manifestation, is a common phenomenon, yet, we know very little about the underlying factors, which may protect some individuals and not others. Placing a new focus on the genomic study of the healthy elderly may be pivotal for advancing our understanding of penetrance. Studying those who remain unaffected late into life, despite harboring known genetic risk variants, could provide important insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately inform clinical care, yet, it has received relatively little attention as a research strategy. The ever increasing use of sequencing technology is further driving the requirement to understand the penetrance of ascertained variants. The ASPREE Biobank of Healthy Ageing provides a unique opportunity to address this area of need. DNA has been collected from a cohort of over 14,000 healthy elderly individuals aged 70 years or older enrolled in an aspirin clinical trial. The ASPREE cohort represents a healthy reference population ascertained without the typical biases of a genetic study. The cohort is depleted of expressed monogenetic disease, yet will contain hundreds of elderly individuals with known PVs in clinically actionable genes. Investigating this population along with other cohorts of the healthy elderly will provide critical new knowledge into the penetrance of actionable variants as a foundation for informing clinical care.","2017-11","2021-08-16 23:14:25","2021-08-16 23:14:25","","637-640","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","1936269356; 28876137","","","","","","","Aged; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Genetic Variation; Healthy Volunteers; Aspirin; Genetic Predisposition to Disease -- genetics; Genetic Testing; genetics; healthy elderly; Humans -- genetics; penetrance; Penetrance; R16CO5Y76E","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This increasing probability of late survival comes with considerable individual, economic and social impact. Physical activity (PA) can influence the ageing process but the specific relationship with healthy ageing (HA) is unclear.METHODSWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies examining the associations of PA with HA. Studies were identified from a systematic search across major electronic databases from inception as January 2017. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled effect size (ES) and 95% CIs. Studies were assessed for methodological quality.RESULTSOverall, 23 studies were identified including 174,114 participants (30% men) with age ranges from 20 to 87 years old. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of HA and PA. Most of the identified studies reported a significant positive association of PA with HA, six reported a non-significant. Meta-analysis revealed that PA is positively associated with HA (ES: 1.39, 95% CI=1.23-1.57, n=17) even if adjusted for publication bias (ES: 1.27, 95% CI=1.11-1.45, n=20).CONCLUSIONSThere is consistent evidence from longitudinal observational studies that PA is positively associated with HA, regardless of definition and measurement. Future research should focus on the implementation of a single metric of HA, on the use of objective measures for PA assessment and on a full-range of confounding adjustment.

Longitudinal data on 766 African-American urban adults participating in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhood of Diversity across the Lifespan study were used. In all, three GRS for SUA were created from known SUA-associated SNP (GRSbase (n 12 SNP), GRSrate (n 3 SNP) and GRStotal (n 15 SNP)). Dietary factors included added sugar, total alcohol, red meat, total fish, legumes, dairy products, caffeine and vitamin C. Mixed-effects linear regression models were conducted.

Contrast between image intensities and T2 values was calculated for various regions, including between individual hippocampal subfields.RESULTSThe T1 contrast-to-noise (CNR) and gray:white signal intensity ratio (GWR) did not change in the hippocampus, but it declined in the cingulate cortex with age. In contrast, T2 CNR and GWR declined in both brain regions. T2 relaxation time was almost constant in gray matter and most (but not all) hippocampal subfields, but increased substantially in white matter, pointing to an age effect on water relaxation in white matter.CONCLUSIONSChanges in T1 and T2 MR characteristics influence the appearance of brain images in later life and should be considered in image analyses of aged subjects. It is speculated that alterations at the cell biology level, with concomitant alterations to the local magnetic environment, reduce dephasing and subsequently prolong spin-echo T2 through reduced diffusion effects in later life.","2016-12","2021-08-16 23:14:26","2021-08-16 23:14:26","","833-842","","6","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","1826703134; 27333937","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain -- diagnostic imaging; Brain; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; White matter; Contrast Media; Contrast-to-noise ratio; Dephasing; Gray matter; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; T2 relaxation; Hippocampus -- diagnostic imaging; White Matter -- diagnostic imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meta-analyses of mortality risk showed significant associations with C-reactive protein (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.42, p<0.001; Cancer-mortality 1.62, p<0.009; CVD-mortality 1.31, p = 0.033), N Terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.43, p<0.001; CHD-mortality 1.58, p<0.001; CVD-mortality 1.67, p<0.001) and white blood cell count (Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality 1.36, p = 0.001). There was also evidence that brain natriuretic peptide, cholesterol fractions, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, granulocytes, homocysteine, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, neutrophils, osteoprotegerin, procollagen type III aminoterminal peptide, serum uric acid, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 and tumour necrosis factor receptor II may predict mortality risk. There was equivocal evidence for the utility of 14 biomarkers and no association with mortality risk for CD40 ligand, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, ferritin, haemoglobin, interleukin-12, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, myelopereoxidase, P-selectin, receptor activator of nuclear factor KappaB ligand, sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone, transferrin, and thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine.CONCLUSIONSTwenty biomarkers should be prioritised as potential predictors of mortality in future studies. More studies using standardised protocols and reporting methods, and which focus on mortality rather than risk of disease or health status as an outcome, are needed.","2015","2021-08-16 23:14:28","2021-08-16 23:14:28","","1","","6","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","1686413287; 26039142","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Cohort Studies; Longevity; Biomarkers; Biomarkers -- blood; Cardiovascular Diseases -- mortality; Cardiovascular Diseases -- blood; MEDLINE; Neoplasms -- blood; Neoplasms -- mortality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, GH rose from 0.096 ± 0.018 (PL) to 0.23 ± 0.063 μg/L (FUL, P = .033), and IGF-I binding protein type 3 (IGFBP-3) from 3.6 ± 0.18 to 4.0 ± 2.0 mg/L (P = .041). Conversely, prolactin fell from 7.1 ± 0.69 (PL) to 5.5 ± 0.57 μg/L (FUL) (P = .05), and IGF-I binding protein type 1 (IGFBP-1) fell from 44 ± 9.4 to 27 ± 4.3 μg/L (P = .048). Moreover, FUL vs PL potentiated mean GH responses to l-arginine/saline (P = .007), l-arginine/ghrelin (P = .008), and l-arginine/GHRH + ghrelin (P = .031), but not l-arginine/GHRH.CONCLUSIONThe potent antiestrogen, FUL, amplifies fasting and secretagogue-driven GH secretion and IGFBP-3 concentrations in postmenopausal women without altering SHBG or sex steroid levels. FUL also suppresses prolactin and IGFBP-1, without altering IGF-I. Thus, a major antiestrogen mediates 3 actions of estrogen: agonism (GH), neutral effects (sex steroids), and estrogen antagonism (prolactin and IGFBP-1).","2014-12","2021-08-16 23:14:29","2021-08-16 23:14:29","","E2557-E2564","","12","99","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","1634280144; 25210881","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Prospective Studies; 12629-01-5; Human Growth Hormone; 4TI98Z838E; Double-Blind Method; Estradiol; 22X328QOC4; 9034-39-3; 94ZLA3W45F; Arginine; Arginine -- pharmacology; Drug Synergism; Estradiol -- analogs & derivatives; Estradiol -- pharmacology; Estrogen Antagonists; Estrogen Antagonists -- pharmacology; Estrogens; Estrogens -- pharmacology; Fulvestrant; Ghrelin; Ghrelin -- pharmacology; Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone; Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone -- pharmacology; Human Growth Hormone -- metabolism; Postmenopause -- metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive training, physical exercise, and other lifestyle habits may help to minimize self-perception of memory loss and a decline in objective memory performance.Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 6-week educational program on memory training, physical activity, stress reduction, and healthy diet led to improved memory performance in older adults.Design: A convenience sample of 115 participants (mean age: 80.9 [SD: 6.0 years]) was recruited from two continuing care retirement communities. The intervention consisted of 60-minute classes held twice weekly with 15-20 participants per class. Testing of both objective and subjective cognitive performance occurred at baseline, preintervention, and postintervention. Objective cognitive measures evaluated changes in five domains: immediate verbal memory, delayed verbal memory, retention of verbal information, memory recognition, and verbal fluency. A standardized metamemory instrument assessed four domains of memory self-awareness: frequency and severity of forgetting, retrospective functioning, and mnemonics use.Results: The intervention program resulted in significant improvements on objective measures of memory, including recognition of word pairs (t([114]) = 3.62, p <0.001) and retention of verbal information from list learning (t([114]) = 2.98, p <0.01). No improvement was found for verbal fluency. Regarding subjective memory measures, the retrospective functioning score increased significantly following the intervention (t([114]) = 4.54, p <0.0001), indicating perception of a better memory.Conclusions: These findings indicate that a 6-week healthy lifestyle program can improve both encoding and recalling of new verbal information, as well as self-perception of memory ability in older adults residing in continuing care retirement communities.","2012-06","2021-08-16 23:14:31","2021-08-18 23:36:58","","514-523","","6","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","1015464798; 21765343","","","","","","","Aged; Exercise; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Style; Aging -- psychology; Cognition; Female; Male; Diet; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Health Behavior; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Prospective Studies; Stress, Psychological -- prevention & control; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Recognition, Psychology; Memory Disorders -- rehabilitation; Patient Education as Topic -- methods; Randomized Controlled Trials; Recognition (Psychology); Memory Disorders -- Rehabilitation; Patient Education -- Methods; Stress, Psychological -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: We used data from five cohorts in the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme: the Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936, the Caerphilly Prospective Study, the Hertfordshire Ageing Study, the Hertfordshire Cohort Study and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921. We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between factors from early and later life and risk of anxiety or depression, defined as scores of 8 or more on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of each. Results: Greater neuroticism, poorer cognitive or physical function, greater disability and taking more medications were associated in cross-sectional analyses with an increased overall likelihood of anxiety or depression. Associations between lower social class, either in childhood or currently, history of heart disease, stroke or diabetes and increased risk of anxiety or depression were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for potential confounding or mediating variables. There was no association between birth weight and anxiety or depression in later life. Conclusions: Anxiety and depression in later life are both strongly linked to personality, cognitive and physical function, disability and state of health, measured concurrently. Possible mechanisms that might underlie these associations are discussed.

Levels of physical capability were generally lower in study participants of older ages, and men performed better than women (for example, results from meta-analyses (N = 14,213 (5 studies)), found that men had 12.62 kg (11.34, 13.90) higher grip strength than women after adjustment for age and body size), although for walking speed, this gender difference was attenuated after adjustment for body size. There was also evidence that the gender difference in grip strength diminished with increasing age, whereas the gender difference in walking speed widened (p<0.01 for interactions between age and gender in both cases). This study highlights not only the presence of age and gender differences in objective measures of physical capability but provides a demonstration that harmonisation of data from several large cohort studies is possible.

The aim of our study was to examine prevalence and risk factors for self-reported medication side effects in an older cohort living independently in the community.METHODSThe Melbourne Longitudinal Study on Healthy Ageing (MELSHA), collected information on those aged 65 years or older living independently in the community and commenced in 1994. Data on medication side effects was collected from the baseline cohort (n = 1000) in face-to-face baseline interviews in 1994 and analysed as cross-sectional data. Risk factors examined were: socio-demographics, health status and medical conditions; medication use and health service factors. Analysis included univariate logistic regression to estimate unadjusted risk and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess confounding and estimate adjusted risk.RESULTSSelf-reported medication side effects were reported by approximately 6.7% (67/1000) of the entire baseline MELSHA cohort, and by 8.5% (65/761) of those on medication. Identified risk factors were increased education level, co-morbidities and health service factors including recency of visiting the pharmacist, attending younger doctors, and their doctor's awareness of their medications. The greatest increase in risk for medication side effects was associated with liver problems and their doctor's awareness of their medications. Aging and gender were not risk factors.CONCLUSIONPrevalence of self-reported medication side effects was comparable with that reported in adults attending General Practices in a primary care setting in Australia. The prevalence and identified risk factors provide further insight and opportunity to develop strategies to address the problem of medication side effects in older people living independently in the community setting.","2010-06-10","2021-08-16 23:14:34","2021-08-19 00:00:36","","37","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","733641307; 20537140","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Residence Characteristics; Victoria; Independent Living -- statistics & numerical data; Residence Characteristics -- statistics & numerical data; Victoria -- epidemiology; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions -- epidemiology; Community Living; Drug Toxicity -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the data constantly reported in literature is the decrease of IL-2 production. An IL-2 central role in the reconstitution of T cell function in vitro is largely documented. Studies on a T-->G polymorphism at -330 nt of IL-2 gene promoter region have demonstrated that T lymphocytes from 330GG homozygous subjects are able to produce in vitro higher amount of IL-2, than -330TG heterozygous or -330TT homozygous subjects. As a genetic background conditioning the maintaining of an efficient immune response would exert positive effects on healthy ageing, we have typed for 330T/G IL-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 168 centenarians and 214 control subjects matched for age and ancestry from Centre and South Italy to check the 330GG genotype association to longevity. The statistical analysis doesn't show a significant difference of genotypic and allelic frequencies at -330 IL-2 T/G SNP among centenarians and controls. Comparing the two cohorts of subjects by extended Mantel Haenszel procedure a marginally significant trend for an increased -330TT genotype frequency was observed. Our data seem to be paradoxical considering the role attributed to a well-conserved T cell function in the successful ageing. On the other hand, in a recent study on a sample of Irish octogenarians a similar distribution of -330T/G genotype even was observed. These data suggest that a genetic background favouring an increased IL-2 production might be detrimental for longevity. On the other hand, an increase of IL-2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokine production characterise the Alzheimer's disease serum profile. All in all our data seem to suggest that reduction of -330G allele frequency might be protective for healthy ageing limiting cell mediated inflammation implied in age associated diseases.","2005-12","2021-08-16 23:14:36","2021-08-16 23:14:36","","425-429","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","70148790; 16518704","","","","","","","Humans; Index Medicus; Female; Male; Aged, 80 and over -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease -- epidemiology; Incidence; Polymorphism, Genetic; Heterozygote; Statistics as Topic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease -- genetics; Aged, 80 and over -- statistics & numerical data; Interleukin-2; Interleukin-2 -- genetics; Italy -- epidemiology; Promoter Regions, Genetic -- genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subjects were 965 Caucasian and African American men and women from Durham NC, East Boston, MA, and New Haven, CT, aged 70 to 79 years, recruited in 1988 through 1989, who completed two follow-up evaluations, one at 3 years and another at 7 years.Results: At the first follow-up, modest but significant declines in naming and spatial ability were associated with the APOE-epsilon4 genotype. By the second follow-up, more pronounced and significant associations were noted between the APOE-epsilon4 genotype and cognitive decline from six of the eight cognitive outcomes. After 7 years, APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers were twice as likely to have declined on a global cognitive score (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.6) as noncarriers.Conclusions: APOE-epsilon4 is associated with cognitive decline among a high-functioning elderly cohort, with effects most pronounced after 7 years of follow-up. Hence, the epsilon4 allele either may function as a risk factor for cognitive impairment in normal aging across a broad spectrum of domains or may exert detectable effects early in a long prodromal AD trajectory.","2003-04-08","2021-08-16 23:14:37","2021-08-18 23:33:24","","1077-1081","","7","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","73167854; 12682309","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Risk Factors; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Cohort Studies; Longitudinal Studies; United States -- epidemiology; Apolipoproteins E; Apolipoproteins E -- genetics; Aging -- genetics; Demography; Alleles; Apolipoprotein E4; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Psychological Tests; Cognition Disorders -- diagnosis; Gene Frequency; Cognition Disorders -- epidemiology; Black Persons; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Univariate Statistics; White Persons; Apolipoproteins; Disease Progression; Cognition Disorders -- genetics; African Continental Ancestry Group -- genetics; European Continental Ancestry Group -- genetics; Questionnaires; Secondary Analysis; Interviews; Logistic Regression; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised; Cognition Disorders -- Familial and Genetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Premature death, childhood variables, and alcohol abuse have been often ignored, as has successful aging.METHODThe authors reviewed the existing literature on health in late life in order to highlight that, increasingly, successful aging is not an oxymoron. The present study followed two cohorts of adolescent boys (237 college students and 332 core-city youth) for 60 years or until death. Complete physical examinations were obtained every 5 years and psychosocial data every 2 years. Predictor variables assessed before age 50 included six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors: parental social class, family cohesion, major depression, ancestral longevity, childhood temperament, and physical health at age 50 and seven variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, exercise, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education. The six outcome variables chosen to assess successful aging at age 70-80 included four objectively assessed variables (physical health, death and disability before age 80, social supports, and mental health) and two self-rated variables (instrumental activities of daily living and life enjoyment).RESULTSMultivariate analysis suggested that ""good"" and ""bad"" aging from age 70-80 could be predicted by variables assessed before age 50. More hopeful still, if the seven variables under some personal control were controlled, depression was the only uncontrollable predictor variable that affected the quality of subjective and objective aging.CONCLUSIONSOne may have greater personal control over one's biopsychosocial health after retirement than previously recognized.","2001-06","2021-08-16 23:14:38","2021-08-16 23:14:38","","839-847","","6","158","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","70896212; 11384887","","","","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Aging -- psychology; Abridged Index Medicus; Male; Adolescent; Adult; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Quality of Life; Longevity; Age Factors; Multivariate Analysis; Health Status Indicators; Probability; Family Relations; Parents; Retirement; Social Class; Temperament","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A relative leptin deficiency might thus be implicated in the increase of fat mass and decrease of serum testosterone levels in elderly men. Therefore, we have reevaluated the age-related changes in serum leptin levels and their relationship with adiposity and androgen levels in a large group of community dwelling men.SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTSSerum leptin and androgen levels were measured in 271 healthy, ambulatory elderly men (median age 74 years), as well as in 61 middle-aged (median 43 years) and 40 young (median 25.5 years) controls. Adiposity was assessed by anthropometrical measurements (body mass index; BMI) and by estimation of fat mass by the bio-impedance method.RESULTSSerum leptin levels, whether or not adjusted for BMI, were found to increase with age, the values tending to level off after the age of 45 years, and were strongly correlated to BMI (r = 0.77) and fat mass assessed by the bio-impedance method (r = 0.81). Linear regression analysis showed a similar slope for the relationship between BMI and serum leptin in the three age groups. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated BMI, age and serum insulin, but not serum testosterone, as significant independent correlates of serum leptin. Serum (free) testosterone levels were negatively correlated with age and serum leptin, also after partialization for BMI: rank correlation coefficients vs. age and serum leptin, respectively, were - 0.20 (P < 0.001) and - 0.16 (P < 0.01) for total testosterone and - 0.60 (P < 0.001) and - 0.23 (P < 0.001) for free testosterone. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and leptin levels emerged as significant independent correlates in a multiple linear regression model for total serum testosterone; BMI and serum insulin became highly significant correlates in the same model when leptin was omitted from the independent variables.CONCLUSIONAgeing in men is accompanied by a rise of serum leptin levels with a maintained strong association between serum leptin and adiposity in elderly men. Testosterone does not appear to be a major determinant of serum leptin in healthy men, while leptin does emerge as a negative correlate of serum testosterone. Increased fat mass and decreased testosterone production in elderly men cannot be attributed to a relative leptin deficiency.","1999-07","2021-08-16 23:14:38","2021-08-16 23:14:38","","81-88","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","69210425; 10468969","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Male; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Adult; Cohort Studies; Aging -- blood; Insulin; Insulin -- blood; Leptin; Leptin -- blood; 57B09Q7FJR; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate; Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate -- blood; 3XMK78S47O; Testosterone; Testosterone -- blood; 67763-96-6; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Linear Models; Obesity -- blood; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 -- blood; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I -- analysis; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin -- analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influences of baseline behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics on patterns of change in performance over 2.5 years are examined.METHODSA cohort of relatively high-functioning men and women, aged 70-79, identified in 1988 by subsampling from three community-based studies on the basis of physical and cognitive function. Baseline assessments included physical performance, sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and behavioral, social, and psychological characteristics. A summary measure of physical performance was developed from tests of balance, gait, lower body strength and coordination, and manual dexterity. In-home assessments were repeated at follow-up in 1991.RESULTSLinear regression models were used to identify significant behavioral, social, and psychological predictors of better performance at follow-up, controlling for known sociodemographic and health status predictors. Significant, independent associations with better performance were found for participation in moderate and/or strenuous exercise activity and greater frequency of emotional support from social networks, particularly among those reporting low frequency of instrumental support. These effects remained significant independent of incident health conditions during follow-up. None of the psychological characteristics was a significant predictor.CONCLUSIONSMaintenance of better physical performance within a high-functioning cohort is influenced by prior exercise behavior and social network emotional support.

Three-year pattern changes in performance are described, and sociodemographic and health status predictors of change are investigated.METHODSA cohort of relatively high-functioning men and women, aged 70-79, was identified in 1988 by subsampling from three community-based studies on the basis of physical and cognitive function. Baseline in-home assessments included tests of physical performance and measurement of sociodemographic characteristics and health status. A summary measure of physical performance was developed from tests of balance, gait, lower body strength and coordination, and manual dexterity. In-home assessments were repeated at follow-up in 1991.RESULTSBetter physical performance at baseline was more common among males, Whites, those reporting higher income and education, and those with fewer chronic conditions. In linear regression models, declines in performance were predicted by older age, lower income, higher education, relative weight and blood pressure, lower peak expiratory flow, prevalent diabetes and incident health conditions and hospitalizations during follow-up. Improvements in performance were also observed; the only significant association was with race (i.e., being Black).CONCLUSIONSDeclines in physical performance within a high-functioning cohort are predictable from sociodemographic and health status characteristics. The patterns of both decline and improvement in performance observed in this cohort suggest that older age is not uniformly associated with declines, indicating the potential for effective interventions to promote more successful aging.","1994-05","2021-08-16 23:14:39","2021-08-16 23:14:39","","M97-108","","3","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","76459599; 8169338","","","","","","","Aged; Aging -- physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Abridged Index Medicus; Female; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Sex Factors; Health Status; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Forecasting; Longitudinal Studies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Activities of Daily Living; Physical Fitness -- physiology; Reproducibility of Results; Linear Models; Income; Motor Skills -- physiology; Postural Balance -- physiology; Gait -- physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Age-cohort differences in performance were observed for every measure (except Finger Tapping) and for overall indices of cognitive functioning, the Average Impairment Rating (AIR) and the Halstead-Reitan Impairment Index (HR II). When traditional cut scores (developed with age-heterogeneous samples) were used, alarmingly high percentages of subjects in the oldest group were defined as brain damaged. These findings were not attributable to higher levels of psychometrically-assessed anxiety and depression in the older groups or for the impaired subjects. Slightly more conservative criteria (fewer diagnoses of brain impairment) were then employed. The first, AIR greater than or equal to 2.00, resulted in a low and more reasonable base rate of brain impairment for the oldest group. The second, AIR greater than 2.00, resulted in age-parity in incidence of brain impairment. The heuristic value of more conservative AIR scores was discussed as were possible uses in applied clinical research settings. The limitations of this approach were noted with regard to its exclusive focus on the problem of false positive diagnoses. It was emphasized that, from a neuropsychological diagnostic perspective, cut scores based on healthy aging samples must ultimately be tested in the context of traditional neuropsychological studies in which external validation with neurosurgical and neurological criteria is employed.","1990","2021-08-16 23:14:39","2021-08-16 23:14:39","","209-220","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","SciTech Premium Collection","80397655; 2131267","","","","","","","Aged; Humans; Index Medicus; Middle Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Sex Factors; Cognition -- physiology; Cohort Studies; Age Factors; Psychometrics; Anxiety; Depression; Neuropsychological Tests -- statistics & numerical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach is to identify gene regulations unique to healthy aging compared with aging in the general population (i.e., ""common"" aging). Here, we leveraged Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data to investigate ""healthy"" and ""common"" aging gene expression regulations at a tissue level in humans and their interconnection with diseases. Using GTEx donors' disease annotations, we defined a ""healthy"" aging cohort for each tissue. We then compared the age-associated genes derived from this cohort with age-associated genes from the ""common"" aging cohort which included all GTEx donors; we also compared the ""healthy"" and ""common"" aging gene expressions with various disease-associated gene expressions to elucidate the relationships among ""healthy,"" ""common"" aging and disease. Our analyses showed that 1. GTEx ""healthy"" and ""common"" aging shared a large number of gene regulations; 2. Despite the substantial commonality, ""healthy"" and ""common"" aging genes also showed distinct function enrichment, and ""common"" aging genes had a higher enrichment for disease genes; 3. Disease-associated gene regulations were overall different from aging gene regulations. However, for genes regulated by both, their regulation directions were largely consistent, implying some aging processes could increase the susceptibility to disease development; and 4. Possible protective mechanisms were associated with some ""healthy"" aging gene regulations. In summary, our work highlights several unique features of GTEx ""healthy"" aging program.

Yet, state-of-the-art pipelines and services for human nuclear genome variant calling and annotation do not handle mitochondrial genome data appropriately. As a consequence, any researcher desiring to add mtDNA variant analysis to their investigations is forced to explore the literature for mtDNA pipelines, evaluate them, and implement their own instance of the desired tool. This task is far from trivial, and can be prohibitive for non-bioinformaticians.RESULTSWe have developed SG-ADVISER mtDNA, a web server to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of mtDNA genomic data coming from next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. The server was built in the context of our SG-ADVISER framework and on top of the MtoolBox platform (Calabrese et al., Bioinformatics 30(21):3115-3117, 2014), and includes most of its functionalities (i.e., assembly of mitochondrial genomes, heteroplasmic fractions, haplogroup assignment, functional and prioritization analysis of mitochondrial variants) as well as a back-end and a front-end interface. The server has been tested with unpublished data from 200 individuals of a healthy aging cohort (Erikson et al., Cell 165(4):1002-1011, 2016) and their data is made publicly available here along with a preliminary analysis of the variants. We observed that individuals over ~90 years old carried low levels of heteroplasmic variants in their genomes.CONCLUSIONSSG-ADVISER mtDNA is a fast and functional tool that allows for variant calling and annotation of human mtDNA data coming from NGS experiments. The server was built with simplicity in mind, and builds on our own experience in interpreting mtDNA variants in the context of sudden death and rare diseases.

Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication. Overall, our results suggest healthy aging is an overlapping but distinct phenotype from exceptional longevity that may be enriched with disease-protective genetic factors.

We aimed to gain insight into how some older adults managed to age successfully despite having a low socioeconomic position (SEP) throughout their lives. Research Design and Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 11 resilient adults over the age of 79 years participating in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants were defined as resilient on the basis of having a low lifetime SEP and favorable trajectories of physical, mental, and social functioning. Grounded Theory coding techniques were applied to identify themes reflecting distinct ways in which participants dealt with what they indicated were the most significant adversities in their lives. The analysis focused on experiences linked to socioeconomic conditions. Results Six themes reflecting psychological, behavioral, and social factors were derived from the data: drawing support from social contacts; investing in younger generations; taking actions to manage or improve socioeconomic conditions; putting the impact of a low SEP into perspective; persevering; and resigning oneself to adversity. Discussion and Implications Findings suggest that successful aging despite a low SEP throughout one’s lifetime requires considerable psychological and social resources. In addition, resignation and specific manifestations of generativity are identified as new elements of resilience.

We designed this study to determine whether physical activity is associated with healthy ageing in later life. METHODS: We recruited a community-representative sample of 12 201 men aged 65-83 years and followed them for 10-13 years. We assessed physical activity at the beginning and the end of the follow-up period. Participants who reported 150 min or more of vigorous physical activity per week were considered physically active. We monitored survival during the follow-up period and, at study exit, assessed the mood, cognition and functional status of survivors. Healthy ageing was defined as being alive at the end of follow-up and having a Patient Health Questionnaire score <10, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status score >27, and no major difficulty in any instrumental or basic activity of daily living. Cox regression and general linear models were used to estimate HR of death and risk ratio (RR) of healthy ageing. Analyses were adjusted for age, education, marital status, smoking, body mass index and history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. RESULTS: Two thousand and fifty-eight (16.9%) participants were physically active at study entry. Active men had lower HR of death over 10-13 years than physically inactive men (HR=0.74, 95% CI=0.68 to 0.81). Among survivors, completion of the follow-up assessment was higher in the physically active than inactive group (risk ratio, RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.08 to 1.30). Physically active men had greater chance of fulfilling criteria for healthy ageing than inactive men (RR=1.35, 95% CI=1.19 to 1.53). Men who were physically active at the baseline and follow-up assessments had the highest chance of healthy ageing compared with inactive men (RR=1.59, 95% CI=1.36 to 1.86). CONCLUSIONS: Sustained physical activity is associated with improved survival and healthy ageing in older men. Vigorous physical activity seems to promote healthy ageing and should be encouraged when safe and feasible.","2014-02","2021-08-16 22:44:53","2021-08-18 18:59:58","","220-225","","3","48","","British Journal of Sports Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group","","","","Aged; Humans; Life Style; Risk Factors; Male; Aged, 80 and over; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Prognosis; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Exercise/*physiology; Aging/*physiology; Survival Analysis; Epidemiology; Longevity/physiology; Western Australia; Health promotion through physical activity; Exercise Physiology; Interview Guides; Longevity -- Physiology; Questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, an intervention based on protection motivation theory, which involved presenting threatening information and coping information, was compared with a general healthy aging intervention, which spent little time actually discussing advance directives. Participants were obtained from a community sample involving church groups and senior centers. Participants were assigned to one of the two interventions. Participants were then asked several questions, including whether or not they had completed an advance directive at 3-month follow-up. Results indicated that those who participated in the healthy aging intervention completed more advance directives than did those in the protection motivation theory intervention. These results are consistent with the tenants of socioemotional selectivity theory, which states that older adults are focused more on maintaining their well-being and are more likely to remember positive information than negative. Advance directive interventions should take into account the developmental stage of older adults and should provide materials that are consistent with their goals and values at this life stage. In this way, advance directive interventions could become more effective at producing more completed documents.","2010-01","2021-08-17 23:52:20","2021-08-17 23:52:20","","49-61","","1","33","","Clinical Gerontologist","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd","","","","Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Aging; Geriatric Assessment; Health Status; Educational Status; Attitude to Health; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Black Persons; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Human; P-Value; Scales; White Persons; Comparative Studies; Income; Coping; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Advance Directives -- In Old Age; Analysis of Covariance; Attitude Measures; Clinical Assessment Tools; Community Living; Decision Making, Patient -- In Old Age; Gerontologic Care; Health Education -- In Old Age; Health Promotion -- In Old Age; Motivation -- In Old Age; Psychological Theory; Summated Rating Scaling; Teaching Methods; Terminal Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Longitudinal data were available from 2,813 retirees and 1,372 older employees. Our results showed that volunteering, providing help and going to sports or social clubs at the baseline improved retirees' quality of life over a period of 2 years. No direct effects of engaging in activities were found for older employees. Moreover, higher depression at the baseline fostered the depression experience at the follow-up in those retirees and older employees who were caring for disabled adults at baseline. In retirees with higher depression at baseline, participation in religious organizations was associated with a greater decrease in depression at follow-up than in those who had lower levels of depression at baseline. For older employees, taking part in political or community organizations at baseline was related to a greater decrease in depression at follow-up than in those employees who experienced higher initial depression. Practitioner points Practitioners should make attempts to reduce physical demands and time pressure exerted over older employees to improve their well-being over time., Practitioners should design intervention programmes and preventive measures that focus on how to stimulate retirees' and older employees' engagement in community and leisure activities to achieve successful ageing.","2013-12","2021-08-17 23:52:21","2021-08-17 23:52:21","","497-521","","4","86","","Journal of Occupational & Organizational Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Europe; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Summated Rating Scaling; Regression; Interviews; Bivariate Statistics; Caregiver Burden -- Risk Factors; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Coefficient Alpha; Community Networks; Depression -- Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Education, Continuing; Employment of Older Workers -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Old Age; Human Activities -- Classification; Multivariate Analysis of Covariance; Psychological Well-Being -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Religion and Religions; Retirement -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Old Age; Social Networks; Volunteer Experiences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We sought to develop a model of successful ageing in a British population, which combines the subjective and objective elements of successful ageing that have previously been proposed. Methods: Structural equation modelling was used to provide a model of successful ageing, defined in subjective and objective terms. The data comprised 15 000 subjects aged &geq;50 years in England, recruited to the Health and Lifestyle Surveys (HALS) (followed up >7 years) and the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA) (followed up >2 years). A model was developed using a 50% random sample from HALS and tested in the other 50% and in ELSA. We examined the association of risk of disease, functioning and engagement with society at baseline with confidence and continued engagement at follow-up. Results: The model developed in the 50% sample of HALS was strong and reproducible in the other data sets. Low risk and good function at baseline are associated with confidence and continued engagement at follow-up, with engagement at baseline independently associated with engagement at follow-up. Conclusions: This model provides reproducible insights on the nature of ageing well, confirming the importance of personal resilience and continued involvement in physical and social activities. Far from retiring, engagement with life and society should be the norm for ageing populations.","2012-02","2021-08-17 23:52:21","2021-08-18 19:16:08","","71-76","","1","22","","European Journal of Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Life Style; Health Behavior; Confidence Intervals; Personal Satisfaction; Reproducibility of Results; Funding Source; Human; Validation Studies; Social Participation; England; Middle Age; Correlational Studies; Secondary Analysis; Goodness of Fit Chi Square Test; Aging -- England; Confidence; Functional Status; Hardiness; Outcomes (Health Care); Physical Activity; Predictive Validity; Prospective Studies -- England; Structural Equation Modeling; Surveys -- England; Wellness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS: 762 men and women, aged 70 to 79 at baseline, who were part of the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging. DESIGN: A longitudinal case-cohort: those with prevalent fractures at baseline were excluded; cases were persons with a medically diagnosed hip, arm, spine, or wrist fracture during the follow-up period (1988-1995). MEASURES: Eight physical performance tests: turning a circle, walking fast, chair stands, timed tap, tandem stand, grip strength, single leg stand, and balance (average of single leg and tandem stands) measured at baseline and follow-up. ANALYSIS: Two fracture groups were defined: (1) those with incident wrist fractures (n = 7) and (2) those with a fracture of the hip, arm, or spine (combined fractures group, n = 16). Change in physical performance was analyzed using crude, age-adjusted, and multiply-adjusted ANCOVA models. RESULTS: The combined fracture group demonstrated statistically significant (P < .05) declines seven of eight of the performance tests compared with individuals without fractures. In contrast, individuals with wrist fractures did not experience a statistically significant decline in any performance measure compared with the no fracture group. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to those without fractures, individuals with a hip, arm, or clinical spinal fracture show similar global declines in physical performance, whereas those with wrist fracture demonstrate no physical performance decrements.","2000-05","2021-08-17 23:52:21","2021-08-17 23:52:21","","546-549","","5","48","","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; T-Tests; Analysis of Covariance; Clinical Assessment Tools; Interviews; Data Analysis Software; Arm Injuries -- In Old Age; Body Weights and Measures -- In Old Age; Comorbidity -- In Old Age; Fractures -- In Old Age; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Hip Fractures -- In Old Age; Spinal Fractures -- In Old Age; Wrist Fractures -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One widely accepted explanation for these alterations that is based on animal data is an age-associated impairment of myocardial relaxation resulting from abnormal myocyte calcium handling. However, an alternative theory based on altered left atrial compliance with aging has been proposed in which early left atrial pressure could be low in the aged heart but rise rapidly during atrial diastole, resulting in a higher late atrial pressure and thus a normal mean pressure. We sought to explore this issue directly by performing a detailed analysis of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure waveform obtained by right-heart catheterization during 5 different loading conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve healthy elderly sedentary subjects (mean age, 69.8+/-3 years) were recruited for the seniors group. An additional 12 young sedentary subjects (mean age, 35+/-8 years) made up the young group. All subjects were rigorously screened for comorbidities. All subjects underwent transthoracic echocardiography to determine Doppler variables of early and late transmitral filling (E and A velocities) and isovolumetric relaxation time. Each subject also underwent pulmonary artery catheterization with measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure waveform during 5 different loading conditions: baseline, lower-body negative pressures of -15 and -30 mm Hg, and rapid saline infusions of 10 to 15 and 20 to 30 mL/kg. Pressure was measured at 6 points of the waveform: point 1, peak of the atrial contraction (a wave); point 2, the left atrial pressure during the start of ventricular systole; point 3, peak of atrial filling (v wave); point 4, earliest left atrial pressure during ventricular filling; and the line between points 5 and 6, pressure during diastasis. Aging resulted in a decrease in the E/A ratio (P<0.001) and a prolongation of the isovolumetric relaxation time (P<0.001) as assessed by echocardiography, but there was no effect of age on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at any point throughout the cardiac cycle (P=0.290). Specifically, at no measured point at any level of cardiac filling volume was the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of the seniors lower than that of the young subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the age-related echocardiographic change of decreasing E/A ratio is not the result of a lowering of early diastolic left atrial pressure.","2005-03-29","2021-08-17 23:52:21","2021-08-17 23:52:21","","1499-1503","","12","111","","Circulation","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Baltimore, Maryland Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Prospective Studies; Ohio; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Netherlands; Diastole; Data Analysis, Statistical; Heart Atrium, Left -- Physiology; Heart Atrium, Left -- Ultrasonography; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure; Texas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the association between depressive symptoms and metabolic syndrome in Japanese community-dwelling older people is unclear. This study was performed to answer this important question. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on 3796 community-dwelling independent older people (>=65 years, 1911 men and 1885 women) from the 2007-2008 baseline examination of the Fujiwara-kyo study, a prospective cohort study on successful aging. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale and metabolic syndrome was defined according to the 2005 International Diabetes Federation. Covariates were social supports, negative life events, health behavior, education, cognitive function, anthropometric status, and others. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the relationships between depressive symptoms and these variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale-15 >=6) and metabolic syndrome were 14.8% and 16.6%, respectively. Significant protective factors against depressive symptoms were higher education, more opportunity for drinking of alcohol, better social supports, and more walking daily. Metabolic syndrome was statistically associated with depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.68).

Whether 25OHD is a long-term risk marker for frailty over a longer time and whether it is consistent with advancing age is unclear.Objective: To investigate the association between 25OHD and frailty in older women followed for 10 years.Design and Setting: Prospective, population-based, cohort study in Malmö, Sweden.Participants: Community-dwelling women, age 75 years (N = 1044) with reassessments at ages 80 (n = 715) and 85 (n = 382) years.Methods: Frailty was quantified using a 10-variable frailty index. Women were categorized as 25OHD insufficient (<50 nmol/L) or sufficient (≥50 nmol/L).Results: At ages 75 and 80 years, women with insufficient 25OHD were frailer than women with sufficient 25OHD (0.23 vs 0.18, P < 0.001; and 0.32 vs 0.25, P = 0.001, respectively). At age 80 years, 25OHD insufficiency was associated with subsequent frailty 5 years later (0.41 vs 0.32; P = 0.011). Accelerated progression of frailty was not associated with lower 25OHD levels, and 25OHD level >75 nmol/L was not additionally beneficial with regard to frailty. No association between 25OHD and frailty was observed at age 85 years. Within the frailty index, variables associated with 25OHD were related to muscle strength and function.Conclusion: In this study, 25OHD insufficiency was associated with increased frailty in all but the oldest old. This study supports the value of maintaining sufficient 25OHD levels for healthy aging.","2019-07-09","2021-08-17 23:52:31","2021-08-17 23:52:31","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","","","","Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Sweden; Disease Progression; Community Living; Vitamin D -- Blood; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Blood; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Complications; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Diagnosis; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: to determine the effect of measuring lower and upper extremities muscular strength on the relationship between strength, mortality and hospitalisation risk in elder men and women. Design: a population-based cohort study using data from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA). Methods: a Spanish population sample of 1,755 elders aged ≥65 years participated in this study. Upper (handgrip and shoulder) and lower limbs (knee and hip) maximal voluntary isometric strength was obtained using standardised techniques and equipment. Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine mortality and hospitalisation over 5.5 and 3 years of followup, respectively. Results: after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including co-morbidities and BMI, hazard ratio of death and hospitalisation was significantly lower in the stronger women and men, but showing regional- and sex-specific differences. That is shoulder, knee and hip muscle regions in women and handgrip and shoulder in men (all P < 0.05). There was a cumulative effect of measuring several muscle strengths over the risk of health events (P < 0.05), so that mortality hazard ratio increased by 45% in women and 25% in men per muscular strength (shoulder, grip, knee and hip) in the weaker strength quartile increase (P <0.01). Conclusions: regional muscle strength is a predictor of medium-term mortality and hospitalisation in elder men and women. Multiple strength measures including lower and upper body limb muscles are better predictors than a single strength measurement.","2015-09","2021-08-17 23:52:32","2021-08-17 23:52:32","","790-795","","5","44","","Age & Ageing","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; Sex Factors; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; P-Value; Scales; Spain; Cause of Death; Anthropometry; Survival Analysis; Hospitalization; Questionnaires; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Secondary Analysis; Functional Status; Data Analysis Software; Mortality -- In Old Age; Association (Research); Exercise Test, Muscular; Inpatients; Lower Extremity; Mann-Whitney U Test; Multicenter Studies -- Spain; Upper Extremity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: N = 3343 men and women aged 70 who participated in a health survey between 2012 and 2017 were included. Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers were used to measure light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-intensity PA (MPA) and ST for 1 week. Incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in terms of stroke or MI, and all-cause mortality were identified using national registers. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox regressions. Results: During a mean follow-up of 2.7 years (0.1–5.6), there were 124 events of CVD or all-cause mortality. After adjusting for potential confounders and mediators, every 30-min/day increment in LPA was associated with 11% lower risk of CVD or all-cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.97), and every 30-min/day increment in MPA was associated with 36% lower risk (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.84). Every 1-h/day increment in ST increased the risk of the outcomes by 33% (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14–1.56), although there was no significant association among participants who performed ≥ 30 min/day MPA (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.82–1.50, P = 0.034 for interaction). None of the associations were modified by sex (P > 0.4 for all). Conclusion: Objectively measured LPA and MPA are each associated with lower risk of stroke, MI or all-cause mortality in 70-year-old individuals, while ST is associated with increased risk. The greatest risk reduction is observed for MPA, which also appears to attenuate some of the increased risks associated with ST.","2021-02","2021-08-17 23:52:32","2021-08-17 23:52:32","","339-349","","2","51","","Sports Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Healthy Aging; Sweden; Women; Accelerometry; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Gerontologic Care; Data Analysis Software; Mortality -- Risk Factors; Actigraphy; International Classification of Diseases; Life Style, Sedentary -- Evaluation; Men; Myocardial Infarction -- Risk Factors; Physical Activity -- Evaluation; Risk Assessment -- In Old Age; Risk Management; Stroke -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the Helsinki Businessmen Study longitudinal cohort, consisting of men born 1919 to 1934. In 1985/86, overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) and metabolic health were determined in 1309 men (median age 60 years). HRQoL was assessed using RAND-36/SF-36 in 2000 and 2007, and all-cause mortality retrieved from registers up to 2018. The proportion of men reaching 90 years was also calculated. Of the men, 469 (35.8%), 538 (41.1%), 276 (21.1%), and 26 (2.0%) were MHN, MHO, MUO and MUN, respectively. During the 32-year follow-up, 72.3% men died. With MHN as reference, adjusted hazard ratio with all-cause mortality was 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 1.27) for MHO, and 1.18 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.47) for MUO. During follow-up, 273 men reached 90 years. With MHN as reference, adjusted odds ratio for MHO was 0.82 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.14) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.95) for MUO.

This has major policy implications for the future organisation of social care. Our objective was to test the effects on social care use, first, of putative changes in the overall disability profile of older people, and second, of alterations to the balance of their care, i.e. whether it was community-based or residential. In order to undertake these experiments, we developed a microsimulation model of the later life course using individual-level data from two official national survey series on health and disability, respectively, to generate a synthetic version which replicated original data and parameter settings. A baseline projection under current settings from 2001 to 2021 showed moderate increases in disability and associated social care use. Artificially decreasing disability levels, below the baseline projection, only moderately reduced the use of community care (both informal and formal). Scenarios implemented by rebalancing towards informal care use moderately reduced formal care use. However, only moderate compensatory increases in community-based care were required to markedly decrease the transition to residential care. The disability impact of demographic ageing may not have a major negative effect on system resources in developed countries like New Zealand. As well as healthy ageing, changing the balance of social care may alleviate the impact of increasing demand due to an expanding population of older people.","2017-05","2021-08-17 23:52:33","2021-08-17 23:52:33","","962-974","","3","25","","Health & Social Care in the Community","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Demography; Prospective Studies; Models, Theoretical; Probability; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; New Zealand; Community Living; Surveys; Functional Status; Logistic Regression; Disabled -- In Old Age -- New Zealand; Residential Care -- In Old Age -- New Zealand; Social Welfare -- New Zealand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of different intervention programs on physical fitness were also described. METHODS: A total of 148 institutionalized elders completed one-year health-promotion intervention programs: aerobic training (AT), strength training (ST), health education program and control. Habitual physical activity (MTI Actigraph), physical fitness (Senior Fitness Test), health related quality of life (MOS SF-36), and body composition (BMI) were assessed. RESULTS: Institutionalized elders performance has significantly deteriorated on functional fitness. Nevertheless, higher results than reference values were obtained on both body strength tests and aerobic endurance, specifically in men. Data of one-year intervention demonstrated that ST induced significant changes in body strength and flexibility test and the AT in lower body strength, aerobic endurance and agility/dynamic balance. The final multilevel model shows that AT Program compared with CG, education level, time of institutionalization and HRQoL were predictors for physical fitness score. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that participation in regular exercise programs (both aerobic and strength training) elicits a number of favorable responses that contribute to healthy aging and could play a role in prevention or reducing functional decline in elders.","2011-03","2021-08-17 23:52:45","2021-08-17 23:52:45","","111-120","","1","51","","Journal of Sports Medicine & Physical Fitness","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Edizioni Minerva Medica","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Forecasting; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; Portugal; Clinical Assessment Tools; Health Education -- In Old Age; Health Promotion -- In Old Age; Repeated Measures; Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36); Regression; Data Analysis Software; Body Weights and Measures -- In Old Age; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Post Hoc Analysis; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Body Composition -- In Old Age; Barthel Index; Random Assignment; Quality of Life -- In Old Age; Pretest-Posttest Design; Institutionalization -- In Old Age; Aerobic Exercises -- In Old Age; Balance, Postural -- In Old Age; Body Mass Index -- In Old Age; Cognition -- In Old Age; Exercise Test -- In Old Age; Exercise Test, Cardiopulmonary -- In Old Age; Exercise Test, Muscular -- In Old Age; Intervention Trials; Multivariate Analysis of Variance; Muscle Strengthening -- In Old Age; Physical Fitness -- In Old Age; Pliability -- In Old Age; Therapeutic Exercise -- Methods -- In Old Age; Training Effect (Physiology) -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cognitive function was evaluated by the two functional tests, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Delayed Recall (WMS-DR), and daily nutrient intake was estimated from a Brief-type Self-administered Diet History Questionnaire (BDHQ). By a multiple regression analysis, among the four major nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate and ash), we detected a significant correlation between the score of cognitive functions assessed by both MoCA and WMS-DR and daily consumption of fat (p = 0.0317 and p = 0.0111, respectively).

Finally, among MUFAs, we observed a significant correlation between the score of both MoCA and WMS-DR and consumption of oleic acid (p = 0.0405 and p = 0.0165, respectively). From these observations, we can propose that daily consumption of fat, especially in oleic acid, has a beneficial effect against cognitive decline in community-dwelling Japanese elderly individuals.","2021-02","2021-08-17 23:52:45","2021-08-17 23:52:45","","284-284","","2","13","","Nutrients","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: MDPI","","","","Aged; Japan; Prospective Studies; Psychological Tests; Human; Multiple Regression; Scales; Healthy Aging; Dietary Fats; Questionnaires; Community Living; Food Intake; Cognition -- Evaluation -- Japan; Cognition Disorders -- Prevention and Control -- In Old Age; Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated; Memory -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors developed a model of relationships between two enduring attributes (educational attainment and negative affect) and two indicators of successful aging (health and life satisfaction). METHODS. A probability sample of 1,177 participants (age 55 and older) were interviewed four times at 6-month intervals. Structural equation models were developed based on the authors' hypothetical model proposing a mediating effect of negative affect between health and successful aging. RESULTS. As predicted, education and negative affect both were directly related to health and life satisfaction. Also, as predicted, negative affect mediated the relationship between education and successful aging indicators. DISCUSSION. Education appears to confer a lifelong advantage for healthy aging. Part of this advantage is accounted for by the relationship between education and trait negative affect. Higher educational attainment is related to lower levels of trait negative affect; lower negative affect results in better health and life satisfaction.","2001-02","2021-08-17 23:52:45","2021-08-17 23:52:45","","92-119","","1","13","","Journal of Aging & Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Thousand Oaks, California Publisher: Sage Publications Inc.","","","","Aged; Aging; Educational Status; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; Marital Status; Middle Age; Interviews; Factor Analysis; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; Affect -- In Old Age; Affect Balance Scale; Kentucky; LISREL; Personal Satisfaction -- In Old Age; Personality -- In Old Age; Probability Sample; Reliability and Validity; Research Instruments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a lack of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies explicitly dealing with barriers and drivers to PA in older adults. Therefore the aims of this study are a) to determine the prevalence of insufficient physical activity (IPA) in 65 to 75-year-olds in Europe and to identify factors associated with IPA in cross-section and b) to identify longitudinal risk factors for IPA in prior active persons.Methods: This study is using data of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). SHARE is a cross-national panel database including individual data of the non-institutionalised population aged 50+ from 27 European countries. For the present paper, we included a cohort that participated in all first four waves of SHARE (2004-2011) aged 65-to-75-years at wave four (male n = 1761, female n = 2085) from 10 European countries. To identify cross-sectional and longitudinal associations, we calculated prevalence odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.Results: The prevalence of IPA in 65-75-year-olds varied widely between countries, ranging from 55.4% to 83.3% in women and from 46.6% to 73.7% in men. IPA was associated with several intrapersonal factors and strength of association was similar for men and women for almost all investigated factors. Statistically significant associated with IPA were socioeconomic factors as low educational level (own and parental) and financial difficulties (male: POR: 1.60: 95%-CI: 1.26-2.03; female: POR: 1.58; 95%-CI: 1.26-1.97) and health-related factors as e.g. number of chronic diseases (male: POR: 1.34: 95%-CI: 1.23-1.45; female: POR: 1.31; 95%-CI: 1.21-1.42). Interpersonal only the size of social network was associated with IPA (male and female: POR: 0.88, 95%-CI: 0.81-0.95). Longitudinally in a fully adjusted model, only grip strength (HR: 0.99; CI-95%: 0.98-0.99) and BMI (HR: 1.02; CI-95%: 1.00-1.04) were statistically significant risk factors for IPA.Conclusions: PA promotion programs for older adults should incorporate the heterogeneity of health status and physical condition that can typically occur in this age group.","2018-04-16","2021-08-17 23:52:45","2021-08-17 23:52:45","","1-11","","1","18","","BMC Geriatrics","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Aged; Exercise; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Europe; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Odds Ratio; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Scales; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Israel; Middle Age; Surveys; Chronic Disease -- Epidemiology; Retirement -- Trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the cross-sectional and prospective relationships between markers of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), with several measures of physical performance in older persons aged 70 to 79 years.Methods: Subjects were 880 high-functioning men and women participating in the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging (n = 1189), a subset of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (n = 4030). Plasma IL-6 and CRP levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and log transformed to normalize the distributions. Physical function measures included handgrip strength, signature time, chair stands (time to complete five repetitions), and 6-m walk time.Results: Women had lower (p < .05) IL-6 levels than men, but there was no significant difference between blacks and whites. IL-6 and CRP levels were higher (p < .05) in current smokers than in nonsmokers and in those with a greater body mass index (BMI). Hours per year undertaking moderate and strenuous physical activity were also related to inflammatory markers with higher (p < .001) IL-6 and CRP levels in less active individuals. After adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and prevalence of morbidity, those in the top two quartiles for walking speed had lower (p = .012) IL-6 levels than those in the bottom quartile. In addition, there was a trend (p = .038) for lower CRP levels in those with higher walking speed. CRP levels were also lower (p = .04) in individuals in the top quartile for grip strength. No significant differences were noted for chair stands or signature time performance. Repeat performance measures obtained on 405 subjects (67% of those eligible at baseline) obtained 7 years later had declined significantly (grip strength, 18%; signature time, 21%; walking speed, 31%; p < .001), except for the chair rise; however, baseline IL-6 and CRP were not associated with a change in performance. However, those who died or who were unable to undergo testing had higher baseline IL-6 and CRP levels (p < .01) and slower walking speed (p < .05).Conclusions: Although IL-6 has been shown to predict onset of disability in older persons and both IL-6 and CRP are associated with mortality risk, these markers of inflammation have only limited associations with physical performance, except for walking measures and grip strength at baseline, and do not predict change in performance 7 years later in a high-functioning subset of older adults.","2000-12","2021-08-17 23:52:45","2021-08-17 23:52:45","","M709-M715","","12","55","","Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Physical Fitness; Female; Male; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Handwriting; Cross Sectional Studies; Aging -- Physiology; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; C-Reactive Protein -- Analysis; Grip Strength -- Physiology; Interleukins -- Blood; Walking -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the association between daytime napping and successful aging, and stratified analyses were performed to explore differences in nighttime sleep duration.Results: A total of 7469 participants were included in the analysis. Daytime napping was prevalent in China's older adults (59.3%). The proportion of study participants with ""successful aging"" was 13.7%. Additionally, 48.6, 91.7, 54.1, 78.5, and 49.1% participants achieved ""low probability of disease,"" ""no disease-related disability,"" ""high cognitive functioning,"" ""high physical functioning,"" and ""active engagement with life,"" respectively.

CLSA-SII was developed using standard methodology for developing other measures, including the multimorbidity resilience and successful aging indices. Associations of the CLSA-SII and four key outcome variables (life satisfaction scale, depression, perceived mental health, and perceived health) were performed using regression analyses. Associations between the CLSA-SII index and the four outcome variables resulted in statistically significant moderate associations in the expected direction, and are consistent with prior research, demonstrating good concurrent validity.","2019-06","2021-08-17 23:52:46","2021-08-17 23:52:46","","180-192","","2","38","","Canadian Journal on Aging","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Mental Health; Prospective Studies; Human; Scales; Validation Studies; Depression; Questionnaires; Instrument Construction; Regression; Hardiness; Instrument Validation; Concurrent Validity; Social Isolation -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SUBJECTS: for the analyses, data of the longitudinal SENECA study were used. The study population consisted of 1091 men and 1109 women aged 70-75 years from Belgium, France, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and Poland. METHODS: this European study started with baseline measurements in 1988-1989 and lasted until 30 April 1999. The study includes data on diet, lifestyle and health. The study population is followed for 10 years, and measurements were performed in 1988/1989 (baseline), 1993, and 1999. The relationships of the three lifestyle factors diet, physical activity, and smoking habits to survival and maintenance of health at old age were investigated. Finally it is discussed whether the relationships of healthy lifestyle habits to survival and health contribute to healthy ageing. RESULTS: the unhealthy lifestyle habits smoking, having a low-quality diet, and being physically inactive were singly related to an increased mortality risk (hazard ratios ranged from 1.2 to 2.1). In addition, inactive and smoking persons had an increased risk for a decline in health status as compared with active and non-smoking people. The net effect of a healthy lifestyle on the process of healthy ageing is likely to go together with a compressed cumulative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: a healthy lifestyle at older ages is positively related to a reduced mortality risk and to a delay in the deterioration in health status. This postponement of the onset of major morbidity is likely to go together with a compressed cumulative morbidity. Therefore, health promotion at older ages can contribute to healthy ageing.","2003-07","2021-08-17 23:52:55","2021-08-17 23:52:55","","427-434","","4","32","","Age & Ageing","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Europe; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Descriptive Statistics; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; Gerontologic Care; Interviews; Mortality -- In Old Age; Diet -- In Old Age; Geriatric Nutrition; Nutritional Assessment -- In Old Age; Self Report -- In Old Age; Diet Records -- In Old Age; Life Style -- In Old Age; Physical Activity -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Sex Factors -- In Old Age; Smoking -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Stratified Random Sample; Survival -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the USA there are substantial differences in mortality by educational attainment, and in Costa Rica there are only minor differences. This contrast motivates an examination of behavioural and biological correlates underlying this difference. Methods The authors used data on adults aged 60 and above from the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Ageing Study (CRELES) (n=2827) and from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n=5607) to analyse the cross-sectional association between educational level and the following risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD): ever smoked, current smoker, sedentary, high saturated fat, high carbohydrates, high calorie diet, obesity, severe obesity, large waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure and BMI. Results There were significantly fewer hazardous levels of risk biomarkers at higher levels of education for more than half (10 out of 17) of the risk factors in the USA, but for less than a third of the outcomes in Costa Rica (five out of 17). Conclusions These results are consistent with the context-specific nature of educational differences in risk factors for CVD and with a non-uniform nature of association of CVD risk factors with education within countries. Our results also demonstrate that social equity in mortality is achieved without uniform equity in all risk factors.","2010-09","2021-08-17 23:52:55","2021-08-18 22:44:33","","821-828","","9","64","","Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BMJ Publishing Group","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Body Mass Index; United States; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Costa Rica; Waist-Hip Ratio; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Life Style, Sedentary; Systolic Pressure; Cardiovascular Risk Factors; C-Reactive Protein -- Blood; Educational Status -- Costa Rica; Lipoproteins, HDL Cholesterol -- Blood; Lipoproteins, LDL -- Blood; Obesity -- Complications; Smoking -- Complications; Triglycerides -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinical data concerning effects on cognition are lacking. Objectives The Walnuts And Healthy Aging study is a 2-center (Barcelona, Spain; Loma Linda, CA) randomized controlled trial examining the cognitive effects of a 2-y walnut intervention in cognitively healthy elders. Methods We randomly allocated 708 free-living elders (63–79 y, 68% women) to a diet enriched with walnuts at ∼15% energy (30–60 g/d) or a control diet (abstention from walnuts). We administered a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery at baseline and 2 y. Change in the global cognition composite was the primary outcome. We performed repeated structural and functional brain MRI in 108 Barcelona participants. Results A total of 636 participants completed the intervention. Besides differences in nutrient intake, participants from Barcelona smoked more, were less educated, and had lower baseline neuropsychological test scores than those from Loma Linda. Walnuts were well tolerated and compliance was good. Modified intention-to-treat analyses (n  = 657) uncovered no between-group differences in the global cognitive composite, with mean changes of −0.072 (95% CI: −0.100, −0.043) in the walnut diet group and −0.086 (95% CI: −0.115, −0.057) in the control diet group (P  = 0.491). Post hoc analyses revealed significant differences in the Barcelona cohort, with unadjusted changes of −0.037 (95% CI: −0.077, 0.002) in the walnut group and −0.097 (95% CI: −0.137, −0.057) in controls (P  = 0.040). Results of brain fMRI in a subset of Barcelona participants indicated greater functional network recruitment in a working memory task in controls. Conclusions Walnut supplementation for 2 y had no effect on cognition in healthy elders. However, brain fMRI and post hoc analyses by site suggest that walnuts might delay cognitive decline in subgroups at higher risk.

We assessed the 2-year effects of a walnut diet versus a control diet on office BP and 24-hours ambulatory BP in free-living elders participating in the Walnuts and Healthy Aging study, a randomized trial testing the effects of walnuts at ≈15% energy on age-related disorders. In a prespecified analysis, we enrolled 305 participants, of whom 236 (75%) completed the study (65% women; age, 69 years; 60% with mild hypertension). Walnuts were well tolerated, and compliance was >98%. Mean baseline office BP was 128/79 mm Hg. Adjusted changes from baseline in mean office systolic BP were -4.61 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.43 to -1.79 mm Hg) in the walnut group and -0.59 mm Hg (-3.38 to 2.21 mm Hg) in controls ( P=0.051). Respective changes in mean systolic 24-hour ambulatory BP were -3.86 mm Hg (CI, -5.45 to -2.26 mm Hg) and -2.00 mm Hg (CI, -3.58 to -0.42 mm Hg; P=0.111). No changes in diastolic BP were observed. In participants in the upper tertile of baseline 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP (>125 mm Hg), mean 2-year systolic 24-hour BP was -8.5 mm Hg (CI, -12 to -5.0 mm Hg) in the walnut group and -2.5 mm Hg (CI, -6.3 to 1.3 mm Hg) in controls ( P=0.034). During the trial, participants in the walnut group required less uptitration of antihypertensive medication and had better overall BP regulation than controls.

Secondarily, the association between change in body mass and composition on change in several cardiometabolic risk factors and mobility was evaluated.Design and Methods: 288 older (X ± SD: 67.0 ± 4.8 years), overweight/obese (BMI 32.8 ± 3.8 kg/m² ) men and women participated in this 18-month randomized, controlled trial. Treatment groups included PA + WL (n = 98), PA-only (n = 97), and a successful aging (SA) health education control (n = 93). DXA-acquired body composition measures (total body fat and lean mass), conventional biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, and 400-m walk time were obtained at baseline and 18 months.Results: Fat mass was significantly reduced from (X ± SE) 36.5 ± 8.9 kg to 31.7 ± 9.0 kg in the PA + WL group (p < 0.01), but remained unchanged from baseline in the PA-only (-0.8 ± 3.8 kg) and SA (-0.0 ± 3.9 kg) group. Lean mass losses were three times greater in the PA + WL groups compared to PA-only or SA groups (-2.5 ± 2.8 kg vs. -0.7 ± 2.2 kg or -0.8 ± 2.4 kg, respectively; p < 0.01); yet due to a larger decrease in fat mass, percent lean mass was significantly increased over baseline in the PA + WL groups (2.1% ± 2.6%; p < 0.01). Fat mass loss was primarily responsible for WL-associated improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, while reduction in body weight, regardless of compartment, was significantly associated with improved mobility.Conclusion: This 18-month PA + WL program resulted in a significant reduction in percent body fat with a concomitant increase in percent body lean mass. Shifts in body weight and composition were associated with favorable changes in clinical parameters of cardiometabolic risk and mobility. Moderate PA without WL had no effect on body composition.","2014-02","2021-08-17 23:52:56","2021-08-17 23:52:56","","325-331","","2","22","","Obesity (19307381)","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Life Style; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Aging; Body Mass Index; Prospective Studies; Walking; Human; Motor Activity; Weight Loss; North Carolina; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Epidemiology; Middle Age; Obesity -- Physiopathology; Cardiovascular Diseases -- Prevention and Control; Adipose Tissue Distribution; Behavior Therapy; Biological Markers -- Blood; Diet, Reducing; Movement Disorders -- Epidemiology; Movement Disorders -- Prevention and Control; Obesity -- Blood; Obesity -- Diet Therapy; Obesity -- Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Ten healthy ageing people and ten clinically labelled with probable AD were recruited. Measurements of language and cognition were collected across one day at 9am, 12pm, 3pm and 6pm. Language samples were evaluated for quantity (total utterances and words per minute) and quality: mazes or fillers, repetitions and revisions, abandoned utterances and type token ratio or percentage of different words to total words. Results: The healthy ageing group performed significantly better on cognitive measures across the day than the AD group. At all times the healthy ageing group produced significantly longer narrative samples that were significantly less aborted and revised than the AD group. Additionally, both groups demonstrated declining narrative performance as the day progressed. Conclusion: Based on these results, time of day may be an additional factor that moderates narrative performance. This change in narrative ability may have an effect on making a proper diagnosis, therapeutic effectiveness and patient interactions, therefore affecting quality of care.","2015-04","2021-08-17 23:52:56","2021-08-17 23:52:56","","31-38","","3","27","","Nursing Older People","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: RCNi","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Circadian Rhythm; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Narratives; Language; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Experimental Studies; Quasi-Experimental Studies; Speech Sample","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although nutritional interventions have long been advocated, little research has directly assessed the effectiveness of nutritional interventions on community-dwelling older adults in urban and rural areas and compared intervention effects on these two populations. Aims and objectives To examine the effectiveness of a 12-week dietary self-management programme for salt-, fluid-, fat- and cholesterol-intake behaviours of community-dwelling older adults and to compare these effects in rural- and urban-dwelling older adults. Methods For this quasi-experimental two-group study, older adults (≥65 years old) were recruited from two randomly selected public health centres in a rural north-eastern county and a northern city of Taiwan from January through December 2011. Outcomes included nutritional status, nutritional self-efficacy and health locus of control. Data were collected at baseline and 12 weeks later. To compare changes in outcome variables over time between the control (usual care) and intervention (nutritional programme) groups and between the urban- and rural-dwelling participants in the experimental group, we used generalised estimating equation analysis. Results Of the 129 participants, 120 completed this study (58 in the intervention group and 62 in the control group). After 12 weeks, the intervention group had significantly better nutritional status and higher internal health locus of control than the control group. Moreover, older rural participants who received the intervention tended towards higher nutritional self-efficacy and internal health locus of control than their urban counterparts. Conclusions Our research findings support the positive effect of our nutritional self-management programme for community-dwelling older adults. The knowledge gained from this study can help stakeholders recognise the need for healthcare policy to establish effective strategies and sustainable intervention programmes for this population, especially those living in rural areas.","2017-09","2021-08-17 23:52:56","2021-08-17 23:52:56","","619-629","","3","31","","Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Body Mass Index; Diet; Nutritional Status; Educational Status; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; Scales; T-Tests; Taiwan; Sample Size; Semi-Structured Interview; Clinical Assessment Tools; Summated Rating Scaling; Random Sample; Coefficient Alpha; Data Analysis Software; Data Analysis, Statistical; Urban Areas; Community Living -- In Old Age; Self-Efficacy; Quasi-Experimental Studies; Feedback; Locus of Control; Nutrition Education -- In Old Age; Rural Areas; Self Care; Variable","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of aerobic and strength-based training programs on functional fitness and mood in older adults, and to assess the relationship between adiposity and mood states. METHODS: Seventy eight participants (age 65 to 95 year old) were randomly assigned to a control group, aerobic training (AT), or strength training group (ST). Functional fitness was assessed using dimensions of the Senior Fitness Test battery relating to lower and upper body strength and flexibility, velocity, agility and dynamic balance, and aerobic endurance. Mood states (depression, tension, fatigue, vigour, anger, and confusion) were determined using the POMS-SF questionnaire. Participants were evaluated at the baseline and at the end of a 16-week exercise programme. RESULTS: Both the ST and AT groups improved their functional fitness following the 16 week training. Body Mass Index (BMI) was positively associated with tension (r=0.30; P<0.01), fatigue (r=0.31; P<0.01) and confusion (r=0.24; P<0.05). At 16-week evaluation, control group reported increased levels of confusion, and the ST group reported increases in vigour (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Results support the idea that strength-based training can be as effective as aerobic-based training in improving physical skills that contribute to functional mobility in later years. Positive associations between increased BMI and mood disturbance were also found. Physical training also contributed to some improvements in mood.","2011-09","2021-08-17 23:52:56","2021-08-17 23:52:56","","489-496","","3","51","","Journal of Sports Medicine & Physical Fitness","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Edizioni Minerva Medica","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Psychological Tests; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; Portugal; Clinical Assessment Tools; Repeated Measures; Coefficient Alpha; Data Analysis Software; Functional Status -- In Old Age; Post Hoc Analysis; Body Composition -- In Old Age; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Random Assignment; Pretest-Posttest Design; Aerobic Exercises -- In Old Age; Balance, Postural -- In Old Age; Body Mass Index -- In Old Age; Exercise Test -- In Old Age; Exercise Test, Muscular -- In Old Age; Intervention Trials; Muscle Strengthening -- In Old Age; Physical Fitness -- In Old Age; Pliability -- In Old Age; Training Effect (Physiology) -- In Old Age; Affect -- In Old Age; Adipose Tissue -- In Old Age; Agility -- In Old Age; Confusion -- In Old Age; Exercise Physiology -- In Old Age; Fatigue -- In Old Age; Physical Endurance -- In Old Age; Stress, Psychological -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Healthy aging is associated with reduced appetite. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of different energy preloads on appetite, plasma cholecystokinin, antral area, and subsequent energy intake in healthy older and young subjects. DESIGN: On 3 separate days, 12 young and 12 older subjects consumed 400 mL of a drink containing either 0 kcal (water), 250 kcal, or 750 kcal 70 min before a buffet-style meal. RESULTS: Hunger was less in the older than in the young subjects (P < 0.001). Both nutrient preloads reduced hunger and increased fullness more than did water (P < 0.02), and older subjects were more full than were the young (P < 0.05). Antral area was greater after the nutrient preloads than after water (P = 0.001) and greater in the older than in the young subjects (P = 0.005). In both groups, food intake was suppressed in an energy-dependent manner (P = 0.008). Plasma cholecystokinin was greater in the older than in the young subjects (P = 0.003). Immediately before the meal, hunger (r = -0.59) and energy intake (r = -0.90) were inversely related and fullness (r = 0.66) was directly related to antral area (all: P < 0.001). Antral area, but not plasma cholecystokinin, was a predictor of subsequent energy intake. CONCLUSION: In healthy young and older subjects, the suppression of subsequent energy intake by a liquid preload is nutrient dependent and comparable, and both satiation and satiety are related to antral area and (presumably) antral distension.

Findings: In this comparative effectiveness study, there was a statistically significant higher rate of hospitalization in the P2P group than the standard community services group during the 12 months of observation. There were no significant differences in the rates of emergency department and urgent care visits or in the composite outcome of any health care utilization between the 2 groups. Meaning: These findings suggest that P2P support programs may change the way in which older adults access health care and lead to greater hospitalization. This comparative effectiveness study investigates whether a community-designed peer-to-peer support program is associated with lower acute health care utilization compared with standard community services among older adults. Importance: The vast majority of older adults desire to age in their communities, and it is not clear what helps them be successful at aging in place. Objective: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of community-designed and community-implemented peer-to-peer (P2P) support programs vs standard community services (SCS) to promote health and wellness in at-risk older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study involved a longitudinal cohort of adults aged 65 years and older conducted between 2015 and 2017. The setting was 3 communities in which community-based organizations delivered P2P services to older adults in California, Florida, and New York. Participants in the P2P group and in the SCS group were matched at enrollment into the study according to age, sex, and race/ethnicity at each site. Data analysis was performed from October 2018 to May 2020. Exposures: P2P support was provided by trained older adult volunteers in the same community. They provided support targeted at the needs of the older adult they served, including transportation assistance, check-in calls, social activities, help with shopping, and trips to medical appointments. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of hospitalization, urgent care (UC) and emergency department (ED) use, and a composite measure of health care utilization were collected over 12 months of follow-up. Results: A total of 503 participants were screened, 456 participants were enrolled and had baseline data (234 in the SCS group and 222 in the P2P group), and 8 participants had no follow-up data, leaving 448 participants for the main analysis (231 in the SCS group and 217 in the P2P group; 363 women [81%]; mean [SD] age, 80 [9] years). Participants in the P2P group more often lived alone, had lower incomes, and were more physically and mentally frail at baseline compared with the SCS group. After adjusting for propensity scores to account for baseline differences between the 2 groups, there was a statistically significant higher rate of hospitalization in the P2P group than in the SCS group (0.68 hospitalization per year vs 0.44 hospitalization per year; risk ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.14-2.07; P =.005) during the 12 months of observation. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of ED or UC visits or composite health care utilization over the 12 months of the study. Conclusions and Relevance: P2P support was associated with higher rates of hospitalization but was not associated with other measures of health care utilization. Given that this is not a randomized clinical trial, it is not clear from these findings whether peer support will help older adults age in place, and the topic deserves further study.","2020-12-15","2021-08-17 23:52:57","2021-08-17 23:52:57","","e2030090-e2030090","","12","3","","JAMA Network Open","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Chicago, Illinois Publisher: American Medical Association","","","","Aged; Female; Male; United States; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Psychological Tests; Health Services for the Aged; Probability; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Scales; T-Tests; Comparative Studies; Healthy Aging; Hospitalization; Community Health Services; Peer Group; Questionnaires; Community Living; Support, Psychosocial; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Logistic Regression; Fisher's Exact Test; Nonexperimental Studies; Emergency Service; Health Resource Utilization -- In Old Age; Office Visits; Support Groups; Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we examine the measurement properties of the LLDI using data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P) study.Methods: LIFE-P participants, aged 70-89 years, were at elevated risk of disability. The 424 participants were enrolled at the Cooper Institute, Stanford University, University of Pittsburgh, and Wake Forest University. Physical activity and successful aging health education interventions were compared after 12-months of follow-up. Using factor analysis, we determined whether the LLDI's factor structure was comparable with that reported previously. We further examined how each item related to measured disability using item response theory (IRT).Results: The factor structure for the limitation domain within the LLDI in the LIFE-P study did not corroborate previous findings. However, the factor structure using the abbreviated version was supported. Social and personal role factors were identified. IRT analysis revealed that each item in the social role factor provided a similar level of information, whereas the items in the personal role factor tended to provide different levels of information.Conclusions: Within the context of community-based clinical intervention research in aged populations, an abbreviated version of the LLDI performed better than the full 16-item version. In addition, the personal subscale would benefit from additional research using IRT.Trial Registration: The protocol of LIFE-P is consistent with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov (registration # NCT00116194).","2010-01","2021-08-17 23:52:57","2021-08-17 23:52:57","","115-115","","","8","","Health & Quality of Life Outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Aged; Life Style; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Disability Evaluation; Pennsylvania; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Pilot Studies; Factor Analysis; Clinical Trials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prevalence of foot problems (pain, peripheral neuropathy, or deformity) increased significantly as frailty category worsened (any problem: 63% in nonfrail, 80% in prefrail [odds ratio (OR) = 2.0], and 95% in frail [OR = 8.3]; P = .03 for trend) due to associations between foot problems and both weakness and exhaustion. Foot problems were associated with fear of falling but not with fall history or incident falls over 6 months. Foot pain and peripheral neuropathy were associated with lower gait speed and stride length; increased double support time; increased mediolateral sway of center of mass during walking, age adjusted; decreased eyes open sway of center of mass and ankle during quiet standing, age adjusted; and lower percentage walking, percentage standing, and total steps per day.Conclusions: Foot problems were associated with frailty level and decreased motor performance and PA. Wearable technology is a practical way to screen for deterioration in gait, balance, and PA that may be associated with foot problems. Routine assessment and management of foot problems could promote earlier intervention to retain motor performance and manage fear of falling in older adults, which may ultimately improve healthy aging and reduce risk of frailty.","2018-03","2021-08-17 23:53:10","2021-08-17 23:53:10","","126-139","","2","108","","Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Bethesda, Maryland Publisher: American Podiatric Medical Association, Inc.","","","","Aged; Exercise; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Accidental Falls; Walking -- Physiology; Balance, Postural -- Physiology; Foot Diseases -- Complications; Foot Diseases -- Epidemiology; Gait -- Physiology; Posture -- Physiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines and provides recommendations for operationalization of diversity-type intraindividual variability (IIV) constructs using intensive longitudinal data, and demonstrates the utility of emodiversity by examining its links to physical health moderated by mean levels of emotion and age. Method: Using data from a daily diary study of 138 adults (age 40 to 65 years), we consider how item selection, response scale, choice of diversity index, and number of occasions enable/constrain mapping to theory, measurement reliability, and empirical inquiry. Results: Item selection and response scale had limited influence on rank-order differences in diversity. Reliable measurement (r ≥ .8) required a minimum of 6 to 12 occasions depending on choice of index, theoretical conception, study design, and distribution of diversity scores. The empirical findings suggest mean level of negative affect, rather than age, moderates the relation between negative emodiversity and health. Discussion: This study provides recommendations for the calculation of diversity-type IIV constructs and illustrates the potential for study of emodiversity to contribute to understanding of successful aging.","2018-01","2021-08-17 23:53:10","2021-08-17 23:53:10","","75-86","","1","73","","Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Health; Aging; Adult; Prospective Studies; Human; Affect; Cultural Diversity; Middle Age; Diaries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods The sample included 340 cognitively healthy twins enrolled in the OCTO-Twin Study, a longitudinal study on cognitive aging. Leisure activity was measured in midlife and cognitive function in old age (mean age 83). Leisure activities covered the domains of domestic, intellectual–cultural, and self-improvement activities. The cognitive assessments comprised 5 measurement occasions (2-year intervals) covering verbal ability, spatial ability, memory, and speed. The association between leisure activity and cognitive function was estimated separately for the genders using growth curve models, adjusting for age and education. Results Men and women had the same level of total leisure activity but differed in activity profiles and in the associations between activity and cognitive function. Higher engagement in self-improvement among men was related to higher level of cognitive functioning. Among women, intellectual–cultural activity was related to better verbal ability and memory. Concerning trajectories of cognitive function, domestic activity among men was related to less decline in speed, whereas for women it was related to steeper decline in spatial ability and memory. Further, higher intellectual–cultural activity among women was related to steeper decline in memory. Discussion Cognitively stimulating activities (i.e. self-improvement and intellectual–cultural), might increase cognitive reserve whereas less cognitively stimulating activities (i.e. domestic) do not. Gender differences should be considered when examining lifestyle factors in relation to cognitive aging.","2020-01","2021-08-17 23:53:10","2021-08-17 23:53:10","","11-20","","1","75","","Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Sex Factors; Memory; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Healthy Aging; Self Concept; Twins; Intelligence; Middle Age; Cognition -- In Old Age; Leisure Activities -- In Adulthood; Population Health; Spatial Perception; Verbal Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were drawn from the 1989, 1993, 1996, and 1999 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan, a national representative population survey of 4,049 participants aged 60 years or older; 43% were women. Successful aging indicators were defined as physical (absence of disease and physical disability), mental (normal cognitive function and absence of depression), and social (good social support and participation in productive activities). Gender differences related to successful aging during the 6 years were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression model. Significant disparities were found between elderly men and women in activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), cognitive function, depressive symptoms, social support and productive activities. When the data included individuals who were deceased, elderly women showed better maintenance of ADL and less vulnerability to IADL impairment than elderly men. However, when the analysis included only survivors during the follow-up, the elderly were more likely to be impaired in IADL and cognitive function, have depressive symptoms, and lack engagement in productive activities. Cumulative disadvantage was associated with health disparities in elderly women. This research demonstrates the need to develop gender-sensitive policies.","2005-05","2021-08-17 23:53:11","2021-08-17 23:53:11","","1-21","","1","42","","Women & Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Geriatric Assessment; Sex Factors; Quality of Life; Women's Health; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Odds Ratio; Psychological Tests; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; Scales; Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Taiwan; Questionnaires; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Middle Age; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Disabled","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the factors influencing GCC thickness in the general population.Objectives: To investigate the heritability of and factors associated with GCC thickness in a healthy aging population.Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional twin study was conducted from August 27, 2014, to March 31, 2016, among 1657 participants of white British ancestry from the TwinsUK study cohort without ocular pathologic conditions. Heritability analyses were conducted in 1432 twins (426 monozygous and 290 dizygous pairs). Association analyses were performed using univariable and multivariable stepwise linear regression models, taking family structure into account. Heritability analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood structural equation twin modeling.Main Outcomes and Measures: Parameters measured included GCC thickness, autorefraction, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, body mass index, and cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and urea levels. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.Results: Among the 1657 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.0 [15.3] years; 89.5% women and 10.5% men), the mean [SD] inner GCC thickness was 96.0 [7.6] μm (95% CI, 95.1-96.2). In multivariable modeling, the mean inner GCC thickness was associated with advancing age (β, -0.14; P < .001), increased body mass index (β, -0.15; P = .001), spherical equivalent (β, 0.70; P < .001), and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (β, 0.03; P = .02). A 1-U increase in age or body mass index was associated with a 0.14-µm and 0.15-µm decrease in GCC thickness, respectively (P < .001), while a 1-U increase in spherical equivalent or estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with a 0.70-µm (P < .001) and 0.03-µm (P = .02) increase in GCC thickness, respectively. Ganglion cell complex thickness was not associated with sex, intraocular pressure, or diabetes. Age-adjusted GCC thickness was highly heritable, with additive genetic effects explaining 81% (95% CI, 78%-84%) of phenotypic variance and individual environmental factors explaining the remaining 19% (95% CI, 16%-22%).Conclusions and Relevance: Ganglion cell complex thickness appears to be highly heritable and further genetic analysis may help identify new biological pathways for glaucoma. The results suggest it may be important to account for age, body mass index, refractive error, and sex when using GCC thickness as a diagnostic tool. Replication of their results is required, as is further research to explain the association between renal function and GCC thickness.","2017-01","2021-08-17 23:53:11","2021-08-18 23:00:26","","31-38","","1","135","","JAMA Ophthalmology","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Chicago, Illinois Publisher: American Medical Association","","","","Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Adult; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Funding Source; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Young Adult; Environmental Exposure; Twins; Middle Age; Adolescence; Disease Attributes; Nerve Fibers -- Pathology; Disease Susceptibility; Glaucoma; Glaucoma -- Diagnosis; Glaucoma -- Etiology; Retina -- Pathology; Tomography, Optical Coherence -- Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, however, strikingly little is known regarding the health and health trajectories of older immigrants. This paper examines the prevalence and predictors of important health behaviors associated with chronic disease prevention, including current smoking status, physical activity, alcohol use, and body mass index (BMI). We analyzed data from the 2003 New York City Chinese Health Survey (NYC CHS), the largest probability-based sample of Chinese immigrants residing in two distinct communities. In-person interviews were conducted with 517 representative men and women aged 55-75. Logistic regression modeling was used to test the influence of demographic, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and health characteristics on selected health behaviors. Results revealed that having more education and better physical health status were associated with greater participation in physical activity. Gender-specific analyses indicated that the effect of selected predictors varied between the sexes. For example, among older Chinese women, acculturation was negatively associated with alcohol use. This study provides some of the first evidence on health behaviors of one of the fastest growing older immigrant groups in the U.S. Study results add to the emerging literature on the complex nature of immigrant health trajectories, and demonstrate that contrary to prior research, living a greater proportion of time in the U.S. can be associated with selected positive health behaviors. Further longitudinal studies are needed to help inform policy initiatives to encourage healthy aging among diverse older immigrant groups.","2009-02","2021-08-17 23:53:11","2021-08-17 23:53:11","","6-15","","1","34","","Journal of Community Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Body Mass Index; Sex Factors; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Promotion; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Smoking; Chi Square Test; Funding Source; Human; Chinese; Education; Alcohol Drinking; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Physical Activity; Logistic Regression; Acculturation; Chronic Disease -- Prevention and Control; Health Behavior -- New York; Immigrants; New York; Policy Making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Home care recipients have a high incidence of falls and a low level of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In this understudied group of older adults, exercise interventions could prevent falls, promote HRQOL and enable healthy ageing in the longer term. Methods The study is a single-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial, lasting 3 months with a follow-up at 6 months, conducted in primary care. The objective was to explore the effects of a falls prevention exercise programme post-intervention at a 6-month follow-up in home care recipients 67+ years with a history of falls. The Otago Exercise Programme lasting 3 months was performed. The primary outcome was HRQOL measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Linear mixed regression models and structural equation models were employed. Results At 6-month follow-up, the intervention group scored significantly higher on SF-36's physical component summary compared with the controls; 3.0 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4, 5.6. This effect was mediated by an increased probability of maintaining exercise in the post-intervention period; odds ratio = 2.3 (CI = 1.1, 5.1). Exercising was associated with a 7.1-point increase in physical component summary (CI = 3.2, 10.9). Conclusion A falls prevention exercise programme can improve physical HRQOL in home care recipients post-intervention. The exercise programme also led to longer-term changes in exercise behaviour mediating this effect.","2020-02","2021-08-17 23:53:11","2021-08-17 23:53:11","","64-69","","1","30","","European Journal of Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Quality of Life; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Questionnaires; Structural Equation Modeling; Primary Health Care; Linear Regression; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Therapeutic Exercise -- Methods; Accidental Falls -- Prevention and Control -- In Old Age; Balance Training, Physical; Home Health Care; Muscle Strengthening; Single-Blind Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was based on the double-blind, randomized trial, Supplementation with Antioxidant Vitamins and Minerals (SU.VI.MAX) Study (1994-2002) and the SU.VI.MAX 2 Follow-up Study (2007-2009). During 1994-2002, participants received a daily combination of vitamin C (120 mg), β-carotene (6 mg), vitamin E (30 mg), selenium (100 µg), and zinc (20 mg) or placebo. Healthy aging was assessed in 2007-2009 by using multiple criteria, including the absence of major chronic disease and good physical and cognitive functioning. Data from a subsample of the SU.VI.MAX 2 cohort, initially free of major chronic disease, with a mean age of 65.3 years in 2007-2009 (n = 3,966), were used to calculate relative risks. Supplementation was associated with a greater healthy aging probability among men (relative risk = 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.29) but not among women (relative risk = 0.98, 95%confidence interval: 0.86, 1.11) or all participants (relative risk = 1.07, 95%confidence interval: 0.99, 1.16).

A cognitive test battery and a modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (mCES-D) were completed by 1982 participants. Cognitive test scores were compared across levels of depressive symptoms, and composite scores created to represent cognitive domains of attention, language, memory, visuospatial, and executive function.

To maximize autonomous functioning is not only a claim of social policy but also primarily an individual need. Part of the challenge of preventing unnecessary dependence in old age is to recognize the diversity among the elderly and the different availability of their physical, psychological and social resources. The aim of this study is to examine the age- and time-related changes in functional autonomy (activities of daily living, ADL, and instrumental activities of daily living, IADL) and the psychophysical resources correlated with these changes in a sample of 441 healthy elderly persons aged 65-95. Furthermore, we are interested in the long-term predictive power of physical resources (objective and subjective health, physical strength) and psychological resources (memory) on functional autonomy. Results show significant age- and time-related deteriorations in functional autonomy and in most psychophysical resources. Structural equation model analyses were performed to test the long-term predictive power of these resources. Results suggest that ADL is better predicted by physical resources than by psychological ones, but for IADL the reverse is the case; here memory variables play a dominant role. Physical and psychological variables are thus specifically related to different components of functional autonomy. This has to be taken into account in the development of preventive and intervention programmes.","2006-11","2021-08-17 23:53:12","2021-08-17 23:53:12","","470-482","","4","11","","Psychology, Health & Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Oxfordshire, Publisher: Routledge","","","","Aged; Sex Factors; Health Status; Memory; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; P-Value; Scales; Muscle Strength; Psychological Well-Being; Structural Equation Modeling; Factor Analysis; Activities of Daily Living -- In Old Age; Autonomy -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Nationally representative cohort study. Setting: China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Participants: Chinese adults aged 60 and older (N=3,740). Measurements: Six CHAI components (systolic blood pressure, peak expiratory flow, Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, fasting glucose, C‐reactive protein) were scored 0 (healthiest), 1, and 2 (unhealthiest) according to sex‐specific tertiles or clinically relevant cut‐points and summed to construct the CHAI (range 0–12). Results: Mean CHAI score was 5.6; 5.7% had a score of 0 to 2 (healthiest), 23.0% a score of 3 or 4, 37.5% a score of 5 or 6, and 33.8% a score of 7 to 12 (unhealthiest). Participants who were younger, more educated, and married were much more likely to have an ideal CHAI profile (score 0–2). Age‐adjusted prevalence of an ideal CHAI profile ranged from 1.7% in the south to 8.1% in the north. After multivariable adjustment, persons with a CHAI score of 3 to 12 had substantially higher odds of mortality, disability, and functional limitation than those with a score of 0 to 2. The CHAI further stratified outcomes for persons with no clinically recognizable comorbidities. Conclusion: Substantial variation exists in the CHAI according to sociodemographic characteristics and geographic regions. The CHAI could identify Chinese elderly adults with low risk of adverse outcomes and provide incremental value for risk prediction beyond clinically diagnosed comorbidities.","2018-07-15","2021-08-17 23:53:12","2021-08-19 00:49:42","","1303-1310","","7","66","","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Cognition; Sex Factors; Educational Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Scales; China; Comorbidity; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Marital Status; Blood Glucose; Peak Expiratory Flow Rate; Mortality -- Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Interviews; Systolic Pressure; Geographic Factors; C-Reactive Protein -- Blood; Healthy Aging -- In Old Age -- China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: A cohort of 218 elderly people (>= 65 years) from Gorenjska region (56.9% women, 43.1% men) participated in the study. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire analyzed with SPSS 20.0 software version. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the basic features of the data in the study. Chi-square test, independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA for testing were employed to determine statistically significant differences between the studied variables (p < 0.05). Results: Results of the study indicate that the respondents are cognizant mainly of only two mental condition, dementia (30.1%) and depression (29.8%), respectively. Statistically significant differences were established as to the source of information in relation to the respondents' place of residence (p = 0.008) and as to whom they would confide their mental health problems, considering the age of the participants (p = 0.008). According to the respondents' opinion, the greatest injury risk factor is carelessness in performing daily activities (81.5%). They experience the biggest fear of injury in winter time (x = 3.80) and when they are alone (x = 3.27). Statistically significant differences were identified in the elderly as concerns the frequency a particular part of the body is injured, by gender (p = 0.028); in the causes allegedly conducing to injury, by age (p = 0.001) and the educational level (p = 0.008); as to where injury occurs, by age (p = 0.004), and the experience of fear of injury, by age (p = 0.004), educational level (p = 0.021) and place of residence (p = 0.002). Discussion and conclusion: The findings of the present research indicate that health promotion programmes for healthy elderly population should be focused on the area of mental health and injury prevention.

Standardized measurements were conducted at baseline in 1988-1989 and were repeated in 1993 and 1999. Diet, physical activity, and smoking, as well as maintenance of health and survival, were assessed. At baseline, considerable differences in lifestyle factors existed among elderly people. Mealtime patterns as well as dietary intake varied across Europe, and geographical patterns were apparent. Similar results were found for engagement in sport or professional activities. The smoking prevalence among women was generally low. Distinct geographical differences were also observed in percentages of deaths during the SENECA study and in overall survival time. A healthy lifestyle was related to stable self-perceived health, a delay in functional dependence, and mortality. Inactivity and smoking, and to a lesser extent a low-quality diet, increased mortality risk. A combined effect of multiple unhealthy lifestyle factors was also observed. The SENECA study showed that a healthy lifestyle at older ages is related to a delay in the deterioration of health status and a reduced mortality risk. Improving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in elderly people across Europe is a great challenge for the European Community.","2004-12","2021-08-17 23:53:23","2021-08-17 23:53:23","","1277-1284","","12","59","","Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Europe; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Health Status -- In Old Age; Self Report; Questionnaires; Physical Activity; Mortality -- In Old Age; Geriatric Nutrition; Food Intake -- Evaluation; Smoking -- Epidemiology; Life Style -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Structured Interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study aimed to determine whether long-term dietary fortification with cysteine increases cysteine and glutathione pools, thus alleviating age-associated low-grade inflammation and resulting in global physiological benefits. Methods: The effect of a 14-week dietary fortification with cysteine was studied in non-inflamed (NI, healthy at baseline) and in spontaneously age-related low-grade inflamed (LGI, prefrail at baseline) 21-month-old rats. Fifty-seven NI rats and 14 LGI rats received cysteine-supplemented diet (4.0 g/kg of free cysteine added to the standard diet containing 2.8 g/kg cysteine). Fifty-six NI rats and 16 LGI rats received a control alanine-supplemented diet. Results: Cysteine fortification in NI rats increased free cysteine ( P < 0.0001) and glutathione ( P < 0.03) in the liver and the small intestine. In LGI rats, cysteine fortification increased total non-protein cysteine ( P < 0.0007) and free cysteine ( P < 0.03) in plasma, and free cysteine ( P < 0.02) and glutathione ( P < 0.01) in liver. Food intake decreased over time in alanine-fed rats ( r = 0.73, P = 0.0002), whereas it was constant in cysteine-fed rats ( r = 0.02, P = 0.68). Cysteine fortification did not affect inflammatory markers, mortality, body weight loss, or tissue masses. Conclusion: Doubling the dietary intake of cysteine in old rats increased cysteine and glutathione pools in selected tissues. Additionally, it alleviated the age-related decline in food intake. Further validation of these effects in the elderly population suffering from age-related anorexia would suggest a useful therapeutic approach to the problem.","2014-04","2021-08-17 23:53:23","2021-08-17 23:53:23","","963-971","","3","53","","European Journal of Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; France; Prospective Studies; Rats; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Comparative Studies; Data Analysis Software; Linear Regression; Mann-Whitney U Test; Geriatric Nutrition; Kaplan-Meier Estimator; Animal Studies; Food Intake -- Evaluation; Body Weight -- Evaluation; Cysteine -- Blood; Cysteine -- Pharmacodynamics; Dietary Supplementation; Glutathione -- Blood; Histological Techniques; In Vivo Studies; Inflammation -- Prevention and Control -- In Old Age; Liver -- Analysis; Log-Rank Test; Proteins -- Metabolism; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, studies providing reliable estimates of the association between protein intake and physical function, and its interaction with physical activity (PA), in community-dwelling older adults are lacking. Objectives We investigated the longitudinal relation between protein intake and physical function, and the interaction with PA. Methods We undertook a pooled analysis of individual participant data from cohorts in the PROMISS (PRevention Of Malnutrition In Senior Subjects in the European Union) consortium (the Health Aging and Body Composition Study, Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging, Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, and Newcastle 85+) in which 5725 community-dwelling older adults were followed up to 8.5 y. The relation between protein intake and walking speed was determined using joint models (linear mixed-effects and Cox proportional hazards models) and the relation with mobility limitation was investigated using multistate models. Results Higher protein intake was modestly protective of decline in walking speed in a dose-dependent manner [e.g. protein intake ≥1.2 compared with 0.8 g/kg adjusted body weight (aBW)/d: β = 0.024, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.032 SD/y], with no clear indication of interaction with PA. Participants with protein intake ≥0.8 g/kg aBW/d had also a lower likelihood of incident mobility limitation, which was observed for each level of PA. This association seemed to be dose-dependent for difficulty walking but not for difficulty climbing stairs. No associations between protein intake and other mobility limitations transitions were observed. Conclusions Higher daily protein intake can reduce physical function decline not only in older adults with protein intake below the current RDA of 0.8 g/kg BW/d, but also in those with a protein intake that is already considered sufficient. This dose-dependent association was observed for each level of PA, suggesting no clear synergistic association between protein intake and PA in relation to physical function.","2021-07","2021-08-17 23:53:24","2021-08-17 23:53:24","","29-41","","1","114","","American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Energy Intake; Aging; Adult; Europe; Prospective Studies; Walking; Body Weight; Confidence Intervals; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Gait; Dietary Proteins; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Physical Activity; Community Living -- In Adulthood -- Europe; Community Living -- In Adulthood -- North America; North America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied this association in a socioeconomically homogenous cohort of businessmen. Methods: The study consists of men (n = 970) from the Helsinki Businessmen Study cohort (born 1919–1928). Five major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (smoking, BMI, blood pressure, serum lipids, fasting glucose), consumption of alcohol and coffee, self-rated health and self-rated fitness, were assessed in 1974, at an average age of 50 years. The number of major risk factors was tested as a risk burden. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and the RAND-36 (SF-36) Physical and Mental health summary scores were calculated from surveys in year 2000, at age of 73 years. Mortality dates were retrieved through 31 March 2018 from the Population Information System of Finland. Results: 244 men survived to the age of 90 representing 25.2% of the study cohort. The survivors had less risk factor burden in midlife, and less morbidity and higher physical health summary score in 2000. Of those with five major risk factors only 7% survived up to 90 years, whereas 51% of those without any risk factors reached that age. Single risk factors reducing odds of reaching 90 years were smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.67), glucose (0.66, 0.49–0.88), BMI (0.63, 0.46–0.86), and cholesterol (0.71, 0.53–0.96).

However, few studies have evaluated adherence to these agents. We sought to prospectively capture the rates and reasons for nonadherence to ChEI and determine factors influencing tolerability and adherence.Methods/design: We designed a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to evaluate the adherence to ChEIs among older adults with AD. Participants include AD patients receiving care within memory care practices in the greater Indianapolis area. Participants will be followed at 6-week intervals up to 18 weeks to measure the primary outcome of ChEI discontinuation and adherence rates and secondary outcomes of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. The primary outcome will be assessed through two methods, a telephone interview of an informal caregiver and electronic medical record data captured from each healthcare system through a regional health information exchange. The secondary outcome will be measured by the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. In addition, the trial will conduct an exploratory evaluation of the pharmacogenomic signatures for the efficacy and the adverse effect responses to ChEIs. We hypothesized that patient-specific factors, including pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetic characteristics, may influence the study outcomes.Discussion: This pragmatic trial will engage a diverse population from multiple memory care practices to evaluate the adherence to and tolerability of ChEIs in a real world setting. Engaging participants from multiple healthcare systems connected through a health information exchange will capture valuable clinical and non-clinical influences on the patterns of utilization and tolerability of a class of medications with a high rate of discontinuation.Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01362686.","2013-01","2021-08-17 23:53:24","2021-08-17 23:53:24","","125-125","","1","14","","Trials","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Human; Brain; Comorbidity; Polypharmacy; Indiana; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease -- Diagnosis; Study Design; Treatment Outcomes; Alzheimer's Disease -- Psychosocial Factors; Alzheimer's Disease -- Drug Therapy; Brain -- Drug Effects; Cholinesterase Inhibitors -- Adverse Effects; Cholinesterase Inhibitors -- Pharmacokinetics; Cholinesterase Inhibitors -- Therapeutic Use; Drug Interactions; Medication Compliance; Memory -- Drug Effects; Nootropic Agents -- Adverse Effects; Nootropic Agents -- Pharmacokinetics; Nootropic Agents -- Therapeutic Use; Pharmacogenetics; Protocols","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 12 months, randomized controlled trial (NU-AGE [New Dietary Strategies Addressing the Specific Needs of Elderly Population for Healthy Aging in Europe]), blood pressure was measured in 1294 healthy participants, aged 65 to 79 years, recruited from 5 European centers, and arterial stiffness in a subset of 225 participants. The intervention group received individually tailored standardized dietary advice and commercially available foods to increase adherence to a Mediterranean diet. The control group continued on their habitual diet and was provided with current national dietary guidance. In the 1142 participants who completed the trial (88.2%), after 1 year the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-5.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -0.4; P=0.03), which was evident in males (-9.2 mm Hg, P=0.02) but not females (-3.1 mm Hg, P=0.37). The -1.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.3 to 0.9) decrease in diastolic pressure after intervention did not reach statistical significance. In a subset (n=225), augmentation index, a measure of arterial stiffness, was improved following intervention (-12.4; 95% CI, -24.4 to -0.5; P=0.04) with no change in pulse wave velocity. The intervention also resulted in an increase in 24-hour urinary potassium (8.8 mmol/L; 95% CI, 0.7-16.9; P=0.03) and in male participants (52%) a reduction in pulse pressure (-6.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -12.0 to -0.2; P=0.04) and 24-hour urinary sodium (-27.1 mmol/L; 95% CI, -53.3 to -1.0; P=0.04).

Methods: Six structured focus group interviews with 28 participants were conducted in Western Finland in 2017. Qualitative content analysis was performed, where both manifest and latent content was considered in a process involving meaning condensation and coding, followed by categorization. Results: The healthy ageing model constituted a useful framework for the conceptualization of mental well-being, illustrating the links between these two constructs. The analysis resulted in a four-dimensional model of mental well-being in oldest old age, the key components being: Activities—enjoyment and fulfilment; Capability—functioning and independence; Orientation—awareness, shifted perspectives and values; and Connectedness—sense of belonging. Conclusions: Although functional status plays an important role for well-being in general, it is not the principal component of self-reported mental well-being within the heterogeneous group of the oldest old. Further, many persons in this age group do not view themselves as passive or dependent, on the contrary, they underline the importance of empowering attitudes, a positive mindset and actively creating circumstances which support their mental well-being.","2020-12","2021-08-17 23:53:24","2021-08-17 23:53:24","","1-11","","1","15","","International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health & Well-Being","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd","","","","Aged; Cognition; Female; Male; Health Status; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Finland; Orientation; Focus Groups; Interviews; Mental Health -- In Old Age; Structured Interview; Conceptual Framework; Consent (Research); Content Analysis; Functional Assessment; Healthy Aging -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Psychological Well-Being -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants Participants in two ethnically informative cohorts (n = 656 white, n = 180 black). Measurements Deviation of biological age from chronological age as a result of smoking and alcohol consumption. Results Greater cigarette consumption was associated with accelerated biological aging, with strong effects evident at even low levels of exposure. In contrast, alcohol consumption was associated with a mixed effect on biological aging and pronounced nonlinear effects. At low and heavy levels of alcohol consumption, there was accelerated biological aging, whereas at intermediate levels of consumption there was a relative decelerating effect. The decelerating effects of alcohol were particularly notable at loci for which methylation increased with age. Conclusion These data support prior epidemiological studies indicating that moderate alcohol use is associated with healthy aging, but we urge caution in interpreting these results. Conversely, smoking has strong negative effects at all levels of consumption. These results also support the use of methylomic indices as a tool for assessing the impact of lifestyle on aging.","2015-12","2021-08-17 23:53:24","2021-08-17 23:53:24","","2519-2525","","12","63","","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Prospective Studies; Smoking; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Alcohol Drinking; Middle Age; Biological Markers; Data Analysis Software; Biological Clocks; Methylation -- Evaluation; Step-Wise Multiple Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That is, it is perceived as a high risk level of cognitive change. The increasing burden of dementia in our society, but also our increasing understanding of its risk factors and potential interventions, require diligent management of MCI in order to find strategies that produce effective prevention of dementia.Aim: To update knowledge regarding mild cognitive impairment, and to bring together and appraise evidence about the main features of clinical interest: definitions, prevalence and stability, risk factors, screening, and management and intervention.Methods: Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.Results and Conclusion: MCI describes a level of impairment in which deteriorating cognitive functions still allow for reasonable independent living, including some compensatory strategies. While there is evidence for some early risk factors, there is still a need to more precisely delineate and distinguish early manifestations of frank dementia from cognitive impairment that is less likely to progress to dementia, and furthermore to develop improved prospective evidence for positive response to intervention. An important limitation derives from the scarcity of studies that take MCI as an endpoint. Strategies for effective management suffer from the same limitation, since most studies have focused on dementia. Behavioural changes may represent the most cost-effective approach.","2016-01","2021-08-17 23:53:24","2021-08-17 23:53:24","","83-93","","","83","","Maturitas","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Cognition; Risk Factors; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Dementia -- Psychosocial Factors; Disease Progression; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Psychosocial Factors; Dementia -- Diagnosis; Nomenclature; Cognition Disorders -- Epidemiology; Cognition Disorders -- Therapy; Consensus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the basic epidemiology of delirium after surgery has been defined, the contribution of delirium to long term outcomes remains uncertain, and novel biomarkers from plasma and neuroimaging have yet to be examined. This program project was designed to contribute to our understanding of the complex multifactorial syndrome of delirium. Design: Long term prospective cohort study. Setting: Three academic medical centers (2 hospitals and 1 coordinating center). Participants: Patients without recognized dementia (targeted cohort = 550 patients) age 70 and older scheduled to undergo elective major surgery are assessed at baseline before surgery, daily during their hospital stay, and for 18 to 36 months after discharge. Measurements: The Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) study is an innovative, interdisciplinary study that includes biomarkers, neuroimaging, cognitive reserve markers, and serial neuropsychological testing to examine the contribution of delirium to long term cognitive and functional decline. The primary goal is to examine the contribution of delirium to long term cognitive and functional decline. In addition, novel risk markers for delirium are being examined, including plasma biomarkers (eg, cytokines, proteomics), advanced neuroimaging markers (eg, volumetric, white matter hyperintensity, noncontrast blood flow, and diffusion tensor measures), and cognitive reserve markers (eg, education, occupation, lifetime activities). Conclusion: Results from this study will contribute to a fuller understanding of the etiology and prognosis of delirium. Ultimately, we hope this project will provide the groundwork for future development of prevention and treatment strategies for delirium, designed to minimize the long term negative impact of delirium in older adults.","2012-11","2021-08-17 23:53:36","2021-08-17 23:53:36","","818.e1-818.e10","","9","13","","Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: New York, New York Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Aged; Cognition; Geriatric Assessment; Educational Status; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Proteomics; Gerontologic Care; Biological Markers; Neuroradiography; Functional Status; Outcomes (Health Care); Surgical Patients; Academic Medical Centers; Employment Status; Cytokines; Delirium -- Etiology -- In Old Age; Delirium -- Prognosis -- In Old Age; Long Term Care; Research, Interdisciplinary; Surgery, Elective -- Adverse Effects -- In Old Age; Treatment Complications, Delayed -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been conceptual discussion of possible mechanisms that link spirituality with positive psychological functioning in older adults, but few empirical examinations of these linking mechanisms over time. The current study examined the role of Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence (SOC) and social support in mediating the effects of spirituality on life satisfaction in older participants over a four-year period. The study used a cross-lagged panel analysis to evaluate longitudinal mediation within a path analysis framework. Results showed that the meaningfulness dimension of SOC mediated the influence of spirituality on life satisfaction over time, suggesting that spirituality may influence older adults' experience and perception of life events, leading to a more positive appraisal of these events as meaningful. Social support was not found to mediate the pathway between spirituality and life satisfaction. This study may be the first to examine the link between spirituality, sense of coherence, social support and wellbeing, as measured by life satisfaction, using longitudinal data from a community sample of older adults. The study provides evidence for the positive role of spirituality in the lives of older people.

A total of 35,533 men were assigned randomly to one of four treatment groups (vitamin E + placebo, selenium + placebo, vitamin E + selenium, placebo + placebo). At the time of the trial's development, NIH had invested substantial resources in evaluating the potential benefits of these antioxidants. To capitalize on the knowledge gained from following a large cohort of healthy, aging males on the effects of selenium and/or vitamin E, ancillary studies with other disease endpoints were solicited.Methods: Four ancillary studies were added. Each drew from the same population but had independent objectives and an endpoint other than prostate cancer. These studies fell into two categories: those prospectively enrolling and following participants (studies of Alzheimer's disease and respiratory function) and those requiring a retrospective medical record review after a reported event (cataracts/age-related macular degeneration and colorectal screening). An examination of the challenges and opportunities of adding ancillary studies is provided. The impact of the ancillary studies on adherence to SELECT was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model.Results: While the addition of ancillary studies appears to have improved participant adherence to the primary trial, this did not come without added complexity. Activation of the ancillary studies happened after the SELECT randomizations had begun resulting in accrual problems to some of the studies. Study site participation in the ancillary trials varied greatly and depended on the interest of the study site principal investigator. Procedures for each were integrated into the primary trial and all monitoring was done by the SELECT Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. The impact of the early closure of the primary trial was different for each of the ancillary trials.Conclusions: The ancillary studies allowed study sites to broaden the research opportunities for their participants. Their implementation was efficient because of the established infrastructure of the primary trial.

However, a longitudinal association between poor oral health and general health has not been reported. We investigated whether poor oral status can predict physical weakening (physical frailty, sarcopenia, and subsequent disability) and identified the longitudinal impact of the accumulated poor oral health (i.e. oral frailty) on adverse health outcomes, including mortality.Methods: A total of 2,011 elderly individuals (aged ≥ 65 years) participated in the baseline survey of the Kashiwa study in 2012. At baseline, 16 oral status measures and covariates such as demographic characteristics were assessed. As outcomes, physical frailty and sarcopenia were assessed at baseline and at follow-up in 2013 and 2014. Physical independence and survival were assessed from 2012 to 2016 at the time of long-term care certification and time of death.Results: Poor oral status as determined by the number of natural teeth, chewing ability, articulatory oral motor skill, tongue pressure, and subjective difficulties in eating and swallowing significantly predicted future physical weakening (new onsets of physical frailty, sarcopenia, and disability). Oral frailty was defined as co-existing poor status in ≥3 of the six measures. Sixteen per cent of participants had oral frailty at baseline, which was significantly associated with 2.4-, 2.2-, 2.3-, and 2.2-fold increased risk of physical frailty, sarcopenia, disability, and mortality, respectively.Conclusion: Accumulated poor oral status strongly predicted the onset of adverse health outcomes, including mortality among the community-dwelling elderly.

The research outcomes confirmed the attraction of adventure for this cohort. Risk engagement and uncertainty were perceived as less important in favour of emotional, social and environmental engagement through fun, excitement and pleasure. The natural environment was considered integral and defining of the experience with the participants demonstrating a strong environmental ethos. Opportunities for building social capital were plentiful and well illustrated. The benefits of engagement for health, wellbeing and successful ageing are identified through the physical, social and psychological domains. The research supports adventure participation as a successful ageing strategy that is relatively low cost, community based, has many preventative health benefits, builds communities and embraces the environment.","2013-05","2021-08-17 23:53:37","2021-08-19 00:23:38","","644-665","","4","33","","Ageing & Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Leisure Activities; Descriptive Statistics; Human; New Zealand; World Health Organization; Semi-Structured Interview; Summated Rating Scaling; Surveys; Data Analysis Software; One-Way Analysis of Variance; Exploratory Research; Multimethod Studies; Natural Environment; Open-Ended Questionnaires; Purposive Sample; Triangulation; Wilderness Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relationship between HbA1c levels and the physical functioning status in later life remains uncertain and so is the possible underlying mechanism.Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 2,565 initially well-functioning community-dwelling older adult aged 55 years and older from the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan. Each participant received baseline measurements of blood HbA1c and inflammatory markers levels and repeated assessments of physical functioning over a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. We used generalized linear mixed-effects regression to estimate the adjusted changes in the odds ratio for self-reported physical functioning impairment and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score according to baseline HbA1c levels (categorized into 0.5% increments from <5.5% to ≥7.0%).Results: HbA1c levels showed a U-shaped relationship with changes in the odds ratio for physical functioning impairment and SPPB score (p for quadratic term < .001). Compared with participants with an HbA1c of 5.5% to <6.0%, those with an HbA1c of <5.5% or ≥7.0% had a higher annual increase in the odds ratio for physical functioning impairment (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] per year, 1.25 [1.04-1.50] and 1.21 [1.04-1.41]) and a higher annualized decrease in SPPB score (coefficient [95% confidence interval], -0.05 [-0.10 to 0.00] and -0.04 [-0.08 to 0.00]). These relationships were nonlinear only in participants with high soluble interleukin-6 receptor levels (>48,124 pg/mL; p for interaction < .05).Conclusions: High and low HbA1c levels at baseline are associated with faster physical functioning decline, particularly among individuals with elevated circulating soluble interleukin-6 receptor, a sign of enhanced interleukin-6 trans-signaling.","2019-06","2021-08-17 23:53:37","2021-08-17 23:53:37","","949-956","","6","74","","Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Human; Aging -- Physiology; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Taiwan; Receptors, Cell Surface -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Screens are thought to be important, especially in an aging population, but there are limited data on participants' impression of screening and their implementation into practice. The first objective of this study was to examine aging adults' perception of a physical therapist–led physical fitness screening tool, the Adult Functional Independence Test (A-Fit). The A-Fit is a comprehensive screen that includes tests of posture, flexibility, balance, mobility, endurance, and strength for those aged 50 years and older. The second objective was to examine the practicality and implementation of the A-Fit, taking into consideration time requirements and the ability of the test components to identify deficits. Methods: This was a cohort study using a convenience sample of 37 participants (26/11 females/males, mean age = 59.6 years). A physical therapist performed the A-Fit to assess participants' physical fitness and then developed a physical activity plan to address the participants' deficits and goals. Performance on the A-Fit, the relationship between the components of the A-Fit, and time to complete the A-Fit were examined. One week after the session, participants' perceptions of the A-Fit and the overall session were assessed by survey. Results and Discussion: Participants strongly agreed that the screen was beneficial, useful, and worth their time. Fifty-eight percent of participants would repeat the A-Fit annually and 42% would pay for this service. Seventy-four percent reported that they would pay between $1 and $100. The average session length was 75 (SD = 13.4) minutes. On average, participants had 5.2 (SD = 3) deficits in physical fitness. Deficits in upper body strength and balance were the most frequent areas of deficits. Only single leg stance balance and ankle strength were highly correlated indicating that most of the A-Fit components were measuring different aspects of fitness. Conclusion: The A-Fit could be a feasible screening tool for physical therapists to implement in the clinical setting and have value in identifying aging adults with declines in physical fitness and those who would benefit from further interventions.","2021-01","2021-08-17 23:53:37","2021-08-17 23:53:37","","E1-E8","","1","44","","Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Baltimore, Maryland Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","","","","Aged; Physical Fitness; Female; Male; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; Analysis of Variance; Human; Scales; Healthy Aging; Walking Speed; Physical Endurance; Posture; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Summated Rating Scaling; Convenience Sample; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Patient Attitudes; Balance, Postural; Consumer Participation; Gait Analysis; Geriatric Functional Assessment -- Methods; Health Screening -- Methods; Pliability; Unpaired T-Tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of the association between physical activity (Active Australia Survey) and psychological distress (Kessler-10). Participants were a sample of 17,689 men age ≥65 yr drawn from a large-scale Australian cohort study of people age 45 years and over (The 45 and Up Study). The likelihood of reporting high or very high levels of psychological distress decreased with increasing weekly sessions of physical activity. Compared with participants reporting no sessions of physical activity, the fully adjusted odds ratio for high or very high psychological distress was .66 (95% CI .51--.85) for men who undertook 1.6 sessions of physical activity per week and decreased to .57 (95% CI, .43--.79) for men who reported 16 or more weekly sessions. The cross-sectional findings show that older men who are more active are less likely to report psychological distress, regardless of their level of functional limitation. Further research, informed by these findings, is required to investigate causal pathways and the temporal sequence of events.","2012-07","2021-08-17 23:53:37","2021-08-19 00:21:13","","300-316","","3","20","","Journal of Aging & Physical Activity","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Champaign, Illinois Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.","","","","Aged; Male; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Human; P-Value; Scales; Self Report; New South Wales; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Data Analysis, Statistical; Logistic Regression; Physical Activity -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Stress, Psychological -- Epidemiology -- In Old Age; Stress, Psychological -- Epidemiology -- New South Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the relative impact of sociodemographics, modifiable lifestyle factors, and health status on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women from Queensland, Australia. Methods: The longitudinal Healthy Aging of Women (HOW) Study examines health-related quality of life (HRQOL measured by the 12-item Short Form [SF-12®] survey [Medical Outcomes Trust, Hanover, CA]); chronic illness; modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking; and sleep disturbance (General Sleep Disturbance Scale [GSDS] (Lee, San Francisco, CA) ≥43 represents poor sleep) in midlife and older women from low- and high-socioeconomic rural and urban areas of South East Queensland, Australia. This article presents cross-sectional data from the 322 women, aged 60-70 years, participating in the HOW study in 2011. Results: For women in this study, sleep disturbance was relatively common, with 23% ( n=83) reporting poor sleeping (GSDS ≥43). Sleep-disturbance scores were strongly correlated with being unemployed or on a disability support pension (β=18.69, p<0.01), sedentary lifestyle (β=23.84, p<0.01), and lower mental (β=−0.60, p<0.01) and physical HRQOL scores (β=−0.32, p=0.01), and these variables explained almost one-third of variance in sleep-disturbance scores (ηρ2=29%). Conclusions: Multivariable analysis revealed that sleep disturbance was correlated with physical and mental HRQOL, disability, and sedentary lifestyle but not other lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics. It may be, however, that modifiable lifestyle factors may indirectly impact sleep by influencing health status.","2014-02","2021-08-17 23:53:38","2021-08-17 23:53:38","","151-158","","2","23","","Journal of Women's Health (15409996)","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: New Rochelle, New York Publisher: Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","","","Aged; Life Style; Female; Aging; Body Mass Index; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Health Behavior; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Australia; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Chi Square Test; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Scales; Postmenopause; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Bivariate Statistics; Data Analysis Software; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Sleep Disorders -- Epidemiology -- Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin resistance and inflammation predict frailty onset. Metformin is a widely used, well-tolerated drug that improves insulin sensitivity and displays anti-inflammatory properties. It is also known to prevent diabetes onset in adults with prediabetes. We hypothesize that metformin in older adults with prediabetes will promote healthy aging and prevent frailty. Here we describe an ongoing placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of metformin for the prevention of frailty in older adults with prediabetes.Methods: Older adults aged more than 65 years are randomized to metformin or placebo and are followed for 2 years. Prediabetes, required for inclusion, is assessed by 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Exclusion criteria are baseline frailty (Fried criteria), diabetes, dementia, untreated depression, active malignancy, or severe cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic diseases. Primary outcome is frailty; secondary outcomes are physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery), systemic and skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, muscle insulin signaling, insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp), glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test), and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). Subjects are followed every 3 months for safety assessments and every 6 months for frailty assessment (Fried criteria) and oral glucose tolerance test, and every 12 or 24 months for secondary outcomes. Enrollment of 120 subjects (completers) will take place over a 2-year period.Conclusion: Metformin is being examined in this study as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent frailty in older adults with prediabetes.

This study examined reading activity to investigate the relationship of a solitary, nonstrenuous activity on aging and mortality. METHODS: A cohort of visually and cognitively intact community-dwelling participants born in 1920-1921, taken from the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study, underwent comprehensive assessment at ages 70 and 78. We collected mortality data spanning 8 years. We dichotomized reading frequency to daily or less and performed data analyses separately by gender. RESULTS: Reading daily was common at both ages 70 (62% of the sample) and 78 (68%) and was associated at baseline with female gender, Western origin, higher socioeconomic and educational statuses, employment, and reduced medications. The hazard ratio for mortality over the 8-year follow-up among men was significantly reduced (hazard ratio = 0.44, 95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.84) after we adjusted for numerous social, medical, and health parameters. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that leisure activities devoid of social or physical benefits may nonetheless contribute to improved aging, predicting reduced mortality among men. A broader definition of leisure activities may be useful when considering the impact of these activities among older people.","2008-03","2021-08-17 23:53:48","2021-08-17 23:53:48","","S73-80","","2","63","","Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Sex Factors; Mortality; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Funding Source; Human; Survival Analysis; Israel; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Repeated Measures; Random Assignment; Men; Structured Interview; Leisure Activities -- Classification; Predictive Research; Reading -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Limited lower extremity functioning performance, as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), has been associated with various negative health outcomes, but little is known about the association of SPPB scores with driving status. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lower (poorer) SPPB scores are associated with an increased rate for being a current nondriver among a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults. Design: The National Health and Aging Trends Study is a longitudinal cohort study. Methods: A population of 5935 participants, surveyed annually from 2011 to 2014 for the National Health and Aging Trends Study, was used to examine the relationship between SPPB and driving status. Using weighted data, multivariable Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations was used to calculate the rate ratios, adjusting for covariates and clustering due to the complex survey design. Results: Participants with a low (poor) SPPB score (0–5) had a rate for being a current nondriver 2.01 times the rate (or 101% increase) of those with a high (good) SPPB score (10–12) (adjusted 95% confidence interval = 1.78–2.26). Limitations: Current nondrivers were not asked whether they planned to resume driving if they had not driven in the previous year. Conclusions: Unlike other factors, such as cognitive decline, lower SPPB scores (poorer lower extremity functioning) are significantly associated with an increased rate of being a current nondriver and are a modifiable risk factor. Further research is needed to examine whether optimum exercises and other physical therapist interventions focused on improving lower extremity strength and balance ultimately improve driving outcomes.","2019-07","2021-08-17 23:53:48","2021-08-17 23:53:48","","862-869","","7","99","","Physical Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Risk Assessment; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Healthy Aging; Poisson Distribution; Task Performance and Analysis; Clinical Assessment Tools; Community Living; Regression; Functional Status; Data Analysis Software; Physical Mobility -- In Old Age; Balance, Postural; Automobile Driving; Lower Extremity -- Physiopathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abstract The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of a single-set RT program on CVD-risk parameters in untrained older women. Forty-eight older women (> 60 years) were randomly assigned to two groups. The training group (SS) performed a 12-week RT program comprised of single sets (10–15 repetitions) in 8 exercises performed 3 times per week. The control group remained pursued normal daily activities with no exercise intervention. Each participant was evaluated for total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides (TG), glucose (GLU) and, C-reactive protein (CRP).

Design and Methods: We examined 8-year trajectories of physical functioning (handgrip strength) and functional health (physical [RAND PHC12], psychological [RAND MHC12], and cognitive [processing speed]) in a large Australian sample (n = 7,485 at baseline) of 3 cohorts (20–24, 40–44, and 60–64 years). Within- and between-person indirect effects of physical activity on the relationship between mastery and health were examined using multilevel structural equation models. Results: Mastery was positively related to within-person change in physical and psychological health for all cohorts, and processing speed for the 60s. Between-person mastery was positively associated with all health domains across all cohorts. Physical activity indirectly influenced the between-person relationships between mastery and handgrip strength, physical health, and psychological health in all cohorts, and between mastery and processing speed for the 60s. Implications: Psychological resources are important mechanisms for functional health as they may drive adaptive behaviors such as physical activity. The within-person association connecting mastery with physical and psychological health trajectories provides promise for interventions that foster or improve a sense of mastery. The findings contribute to the understanding of complex relationships between personal resources and behaviors that aid in successful aging across the life span.","2015-02","2021-08-17 23:53:48","2021-08-17 23:53:48","","120-131","","1","55","","Gerontologist","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Female; Male; Aging; Adult; Prospective Studies; Australia; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Scales; Models, Statistical; Middle Age; Functional Status; Physical Activity; Data Analysis Software; Grip Strength; Life Cycle; Maximum Likelihood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They were also asked to complete the Cantonese version of the Voice Handicap Index to ascertain their voice-related quality of life. Over one-fourth (27.7%) of participants reported having current voice problems. Perceived voice problems were found to pose significant negative impacts on the older individuals' voice-related quality of life. The prevalence of voice problems and extent of impacts of voice-related quality of life were similar across the young-old, old-old, and the oldest-old groups of participants. The results suggest that voice problems are common in the older population and should not be underestimated.

Case-control studies suggest the APOE4 link to AD is stronger in women. We examined the APOE4-by-sex interaction in conversion risk (from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or from MCI to AD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels.Methods: Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for an APOE-by-sex interaction on conversion in controls (n = 5,496) and MCI patients (n = 2,588). The interaction was also tested in CSF biomarker levels of 980 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.Results: Among controls, male and female carriers were more likely to convert to MCI/AD, but the effect was stronger in women (HR = 1.81 for women; HR = 1.27 for men; interaction: p = 0.011). The interaction remained significant in a predefined subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes. Among MCI patients, both male and female APOE4 carriers were more likely to convert to AD (HR = 2.16 for women; HR = 1.64 for men); the interaction was not significant (p = 0.14). In the subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes, the interaction was significant (p = 0.02; HR = 2.17 for women; HR = 1.51 for men). The APOE4-by-sex interaction on biomarker levels was significant for MCI patients for total tau and the tau-to-Aβ ratio (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02, respectively; more AD-like in women).Interpretation: APOE4 confers greater AD risk in women. Biomarker results suggest that increased APOE-related risk in women may be associated with tau pathology. These findings have important clinical implications and suggest novel research approaches into AD pathogenesis.","2014-04","2021-08-17 23:53:49","2021-08-17 23:53:49","","563-573","","4","75","","Annals of Neurology","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Hoboken, New Jersey Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Aged; Risk Factors; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Apolipoproteins; Cognition Disorders; Cox Proportional Hazards Model; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Nerve Tissue Proteins -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Peptides -- Cerebrospinal Fluid; Case Control Studies; Disease Susceptibility; Resource Databases; Apolipoproteins -- Classification; Genetic Screening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the role of skeletal muscle mass and body fat percentage (BF%), in the level of successful ageing. Methods during 2005–2011, 2663 older (aged 65–100 years) from 21 Mediterranean islands and the rural Mani region (Peloponnesus) of Greece were voluntarily enrolled in the study. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and BF% were calculated using population formulas. Dietary habits, energy intake, expenditure and energy balance were derived throughout standard procedures. A successful ageing index ranging from 0 to 10 was used. Results The mean ASM mass was 24 ± 6.0 kg, the SMI was 0.84 ± 0.21 and the BF% was 44%. Females had lower SMI and higher BF% in comparison with males, respectively [(SMI: 0.66 ± 0.09 vs. 1.03 ± 0.11; BF%: 51% vs. 34%, (p < 0.001)]. High successful agers had better rates in ASM (p = 0.01), SMI (p < 0.001) and BF% (p < 0.001), compared with the medium and low successful ones. Changes in SMI [b-coefficient (95% CI):2.14 (1.57 to 2.71)] were positively associated with successful ageing, while changes in BF% [b-coefficient (95% CI): −0.04 (−0.05 to −0.03)] were inversely associated with successful ageing. Results from sensitivity analysis showed that the effects of variations on body composition were consistent, less pronounced in the positive energy balance group and more pronounced among the oldest old. Conclusions Body composition changes seem to be associated with lower quality of life in the older adults, as measured through successful ageing.","2016-09","2021-08-17 23:53:49","2021-08-17 23:53:49","","95-101","","","66","","Archives of Gerontology & Geriatrics","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","Aged; Energy Intake; Adipose Tissue; Aging; Energy Metabolism; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; P-Value; Greece; Food Habits; Fat Free Mass; Mediterranean Islands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is still known about the nature of sleep in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is presumably situated on the continuum from healthy aging to dementia. This unsystematic review summarizes the current literature on the prevalence and severity of sleep disturbances in MCI.Methods: Eighteen studies addressing sleep/night-time disturbances among other neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with MCI were identified through a search of databases and an examination of reference lists of selected papers. Fifteen of those studies reported data on prevalence or severity of sleep/night-time disturbances.Results: Results indicated that 14-59% of patients with MCI had sleep disturbances. These disturbances were often identified as one of the four most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptoms of MCI and were considered as clinically significant in some studies. In addition, there was some evidence that the prevalence of sleep disturbances in MCI is intermediate between that of normal aging and dementia. Longitudinal data suggest that sleep problems are associated with both incident MCI and dementia.Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are one of the core non-cognitive symptoms of MCI. It remains to be known whether sleep problems could help to identify those individuals with MCI who will eventually develop dementia. Studies characterizing sleep more systematically are needed to verify this proposition and to clarify the associations between sleep disturbances and other neuropsychiatric symptoms of MCI.","2009-08","2021-08-17 23:53:49","2021-08-17 23:53:49","","654-666","","4","21","","International Psychogeriatrics","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Comorbidity; Middle Age; Alzheimer's Disease -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Diagnosis; Cognition Disorders -- Epidemiology; Alzheimer's Disease -- Epidemiology; Insomnia -- Diagnosis; Insomnia -- Epidemiology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants reported sleep duration in 1998-2000 and 2002-2004, and all stroke cases were recorded until March 31, 2009. For the meta-analysis, we searched Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for prospective studies published until May 2014, and pooled effect estimates using a weighted random-effect model.Results: After 9.5 years of follow-up, 346 cases of stroke occurred. Long sleep was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 1.98]) after adjustment for all covariates. The association remained robust among those without preexisting diseases and those who reported sleeping well. The association for short sleep was smaller (and not statistically significant) (HR = 1.18 [95% CI 0.91, 1.53]). There was a higher stroke risk among those who reported persistently long sleep or a substantial increase in sleep duration over time, compared to those reporting persistently average sleep.

Additive and interactive models were used to examine cross-sectional associations among race/ethnicity, SES, and distress. Although decreases in distress generally occur with aging, findings suggest that social structural factors can influence distress even among elderly people. Blacks were less distressed than Whites when SES was controlled. There was a gradient between education and distress among Whites but not among Blacks. Measures of social support and control did not mediate effects of race/ethnicity on distress.

On the other hand, even the strongest associations were what are generally considered 'small effects' (r<0.30).

However, little is known about the interaction between these concepts. The aim was to examine how SN, SES and neighbourhood type are associated with QoL in older adults. Methods : Wave 4 (year 2011) and wave 6 (year 2015) data from the longitudinal Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe were used for the analysis. Multilevel regression models estimated the associations including 34 792 participants from wave 4 and 67 334 participants from wave 6 from 16 countries (mean age = 66.45 years). The outcome variable was QoL, independent variables were SES (education and making end meet) and neighbourhood type (housing type and housing area), and SN variables (satisfaction and size) were the moderators. Results : SES and SN variables were positively associated with QoL. Living in a house or duplex was positively associated with QoL compared with living in a farmhouse. SN moderated the association between education and QoL. The effect of area type on QoL was moderated by SN size. SN satisfaction was an independent correlate of QoL. Conclusion : Older adults' satisfaction with their SN may be more important than having a large SN. Low SES older adults may be more prone to having weak SN. Maintaining and creating supportive SN may attenuate the negative effects of low SES or less favourable neighbourhood characteristics.","2021-06","2021-08-17 23:53:49","2021-08-17 23:53:49","","541-547","","3","31","","European Journal of Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Europe; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Retirement; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Multiple Regression; Comparative Studies; Healthy Aging; Residence Characteristics; Housing; Surveys; Correlational Studies; Outcomes (Health Care); Quality of Life -- In Old Age -- Europe; Social Networks -- Psychosocial Factors -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding social patterning in grip strength at different life stages could improve insight into inequalities in age-related decline and when in the life course interventions could prevent the emergence of inequalities.Methods: Using United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) data on 19,292 people aged 16 to 99, fractional polynomial models were fitted to identify which function of age best described its association with grip strength. Linear regressions were used to establish whether socio-economic position (SEP), as measured by maternal education, highest educational qualification and income, was associated with grip strength. To test whether the association between age and grip strength was modified by SEP, interactions between SEP and the age terms were added. Differentiation was used to identify the age at which grip strength was highest for men and women and predicted levels of grip strength at peak were compared.Results: SEP is significantly associated with grip strength on all SEP measures, except education for men. Grip strength is highest at a younger age, and less strong for all measures of disadvantage for women and most measures for men. Interaction terms were not statistically significant indicating that the association between age and grip strength was not modified by SEP. Grip strength peak was 29.3 kg at age 33 for women with disadvantaged childhood SEP compared with 30.2 kg at age 35 for women with advantaged childhood SEP.Conclusion: The SEP differences in age and level of peak grip strength could be indicative of decline in muscle strength beginning earlier and from a lower base for disadvantaged groups. This could impact on the capacity for healthy ageing for those with disadvantaged SEP.","2018-03-21","2021-08-17 23:53:49","2021-08-17 23:53:49","","1-1","","","18","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Comparative Studies; Evaluation Research; Multicenter Studies; Validation Studies; Health Status Disparities; Young Adult; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Adolescence; Impact of Events Scale; Social Readjustment Rating Scale; Grip Strength","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear regression analyses revealed that participants receiving more emotional support had better baseline performance, as did those who were unmarried and those reporting greater conflict with network members. Greater baseline emotional support was also a significant predictor of better cognitive function at the 7.5-year follow-up, controlling for baseline cognitive function and known sociodemographic, behavioral, psychological, and health status predictors of cognitive aging. The findings suggest the potential value of further research on the role of the social environment in protecting against cognitive declines at older ages.

Multilevel modeling examined longitudinal within-person associations between D-dimer, social support, and SA. Social support moderated the relationship between D-dimer and SA and was significant among PWH and older individuals (ages 56–65), but not HIV− or younger cohorts. This association was significant only at extreme levels of social support, with significant decreases in social support potentiating the negative impact of D-dimer on SA and significant increases in social support facilitating increased SA. Despite declining health, high social support may improve SA in PWH and older adults, and low support may be especially problematic for older adults.","2020-12","2021-08-17 23:53:50","2021-08-17 23:53:50","","979-988","","6","43","","Journal of Behavioral Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Psychological Well-Being; Middle Age; Support, Psychosocial; HIV-Positive Persons -- Psychosocial Factors; Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products -- Blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, much of the available evidence on physical activity and older adults has focused on aerobic activity, while there is less research on the benefits of exercise that is performed specifically to strengthen muscles. Aims: Using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, the purpose of this study was to determine if strength training is associated with better functional fitness and health among older adults who meet the minimum guidelines for aerobic physical activity. Methods: Older adults who met guidelines for aerobic physical activity (≥ 60 years, N = 9100) completed performance-based assessments of physical function and self-reported their physical activity, perceived health, and chronic conditions. Body fat was determined using DEXA. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether strength training was associated with better functional fitness, body composition, and health. Results: 32.5% of active older adults reported engaging in strength training 1–7 days per week. Participating in any strength training was associated with better scores on measures of balance (OR 1.17, CI 1.04, 1.32), mobility (OR 1.32, CI 1.18, 1.47), body fatness (OR 1.58, CI 1.38, 1.81), and better perceived health (OR 1.34, CI 1.19, 1.51), and healthy aging (OR 1.26, CI 1.12, 1.42). Discussion: These results suggest that all older adults, even those who are active and have good mobility, may benefit from strength training. Conclusion: Physical activity guidelines should place a greater emphasis on strength training for older adults.","2019-09","2021-08-17 23:54:01","2021-08-17 23:54:01","","1257-1263","","9","31","","Aging Clinical & Experimental Research","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; Aging; Body Composition; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Self Report; Canada; Middle Age; Functional Status; Outcomes (Health Care); Healthy Aging -- In Old Age; Physical Activity -- In Old Age; Logistic Regression; Aerobic Exercises -- In Old Age; Physical Fitness -- In Old Age; Attitude to Health -- In Old Age; Physical Mobility; Resistance Training -- In Old Age -- Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of those who witnessed the Biafran War (also known as Nigerian Civil War) as children are well into late adulthood, while the majority of this pre-war/wartime cohort who are in their golden years will enter into later life in less than a decade from now. The aim of the present research was to examine the role of stressful life events and family support in successful ageing of the BWG. Method: Data were collected using a self-administered survey completed by 453 members of the BWG who were ≥45 years. The survey included measures such as the Successful Ageing Inventory, Life Events Inventory, and family support subscale of Family Dynamics Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses of the study. Results: The three dimensions of stressful life events (health events, interpersonal events and work-related/financial events) had moderate negative relationships with successful ageing. Family support was moderately and positively associated with successful ageing. For the moderation hypotheses, family support was a significant moderator of only the relationship between work-related stressful life events and successful ageing, especially for the <65 years subgroup. Conclusion: Growing old can be a very positive experience for both the individual and the society. Family support provides social protection for older people, in the face of difficult socio-economic circumstances.","2017-01","2021-08-17 23:54:01","2021-08-18 23:52:56","","95-103","","1","21","","Aging & Mental Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Oxfordshire, Publisher: Routledge","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Educational Status; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Psychological Tests; Life Expectancy; Family; Life Change Events; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Multiple Regression; P-Value; Scales; Self Report; Marital Status; Nigeria; Middle Age; Surveys; Correlational Studies; Support, Psychosocial; Coefficient Alpha; Post Hoc Analysis; Pearson's Correlation Coefficient; Stress, Psychological -- Psychosocial Factors; Hypothesis; Variable; War -- Nigeria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Less is known about the role of wellbeing for subclinical disease trajectories as captured via glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). We aimed to explore the association between subjective wellbeing and future HbA1c levels, and the role of sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors in this association. Methods: We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing for this study (N = 2161). Subjective wellbeing (CASP-19) was measured at wave 2 and HbA1c was measured 8 years later at wave 6. Participants were free from diabetes at baseline. We conducted a series of analyses to examine the extent to which the association was accounted for by a range of sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors in linear regression models. Results: Models showed that subjective wellbeing (CASP-19 total score) was inversely associated with HbA1c 8 years later after controlling for depressive symptoms, age, sex, and baseline HbA1c (B = −0.035, 95% CI −0.060 to –0.011, p = 0.005). Inclusion of sociodemographic variables and behavioral factors in models accounted for a large proportion (17.0% and 24.5%, respectively) of the relationship between wellbeing and later HbA1c; clinical risk factors explained a smaller proportion of the relationship (3.4%). Conclusions: Poorer subjective wellbeing is associated with greater HbA1c over 8 years of follow-up and this relationship can in part be explained by sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors among older adults.","2020-08","2021-08-17 23:54:01","2021-08-17 23:54:01","","1820-1828","","11","50","","Psychological Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Scales; Diabetes Mellitus -- Risk Factors; Psychological Well-Being -- In Old Age; Healthy Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated -- Blood -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Premature death, childhood variables, and alcohol abuse have been often ignored, as has successful aging. METHOD: The authors reviewed the existing literature on health in late life in order to highlight that, increasingly, successful aging is not an oxymoron. The present study followed two cohorts of adolescent boys (237 college students and 332 core-city youth) for 60 years or until death. Complete physical examinations were obtained every 5 years and psychosocial data every 2 years. Predictor variables assessed before age 50 included six variables reflecting uncontrollable factors: parental social class, family cohesion, major depression, ancestral longevity, childhood temperament, and physical health at age 50 and seven variables reflecting (at least some) personal control: alcohol abuse, smoking, marital stability, exercise, body mass index, coping mechanisms, and education. The six outcome variables chosen to assess successful aging at age 70-80 included four objectively assessed variables (physical health, death and disability before age 80, social supports, and mental health) and two self-rated variables (instrumental activities of daily living and life enjoyment). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis suggested that 'good' and 'bad' aging from age 70-80 could be predicted by variables assessed before age 50. More hopeful still, if the seven variables under some personal control were controlled, depression was the only uncontrollable predictor variable that affected the quality of subjective and objective aging. CONCLUSIONS: One may have greater personal control over one's biopsychosocial health after retirement than previously recognized.","2001-06","2021-08-17 23:54:01","2021-08-17 23:54:01","","839-847","","6","158","","American Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Arlington, Virginia Publisher: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.","","","","Aged; Male; Adult; Health Status; Quality of Life; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Health Status Indicators; Probability; Family Relations; Parents; Retirement; Social Class; Temperament; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; Aging -- Psychosocial Factors; Middle Age; Adolescence; Logistic Regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to date the evidence on how social participation affects health, both subjective and objective, remains limited, especially since most studies do not account for the reciprocal relationship. The aim of this study is to analyse how changes in social participation affect both the subjective and objective health of older Europeans as well as how changes in health status affect social participation. Using longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the results suggest that both the uptake as well as the continuation of social activities increase the chances of improvements in subjective as well as objective health. Furthermore, improvements in self-rated health as well as grip strength significantly increase the chances of taking up new activities as well as continuing with existing ones. Country effect is not as strong as expected and the benefits could be homogeneous across different cultures once we control for socio-economic status. Overall, the results stress the need for taking into account the reciprocal relationship between social participation and health. The paper highlights the importance of focusing on both uptake and continuation of social participation when devising policy aimed at improving healthy ageing.","2016-05","2021-08-17 23:54:03","2021-08-17 23:54:03","","968-987","","5","36","","Ageing & Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Europe; Socioeconomic Factors; Prospective Studies; Retirement; Human; Self Report; Middle Age; Surveys; Grip Strength; Health Status -- In Old Age -- Europe; Health Status -- Psychosocial Factors; Social Participation -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Persistent knowledge gaps are barriers to developing and implementing a safe and effective public health strategy to prevent vitamin D deficiency and maintain nutritional adequacy throughout the year. The European Commission-funded ODIN project (Food-based solutions for optimal vitamin D nutrition and health through the life cycle) will provide the evidence base to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve nutrition and public health through food. ODIN will deliver the first internationally comparable dataset of vitamin D status and report the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency across Europe for the first time. In a series of dose-response randomised controlled trials, ODIN will estimate dietary requirements for vitamin D in pregnant women, children, adolescents and adults of South Asian and East African origin resident in Northern European countries. Using clinically validated, disease-specific cohorts with standardised 25( OH)D data, ODIN will investigate associations between vitamin D status and perinatal outcomes, atopic disease and bone growth in children, and cardiovascular and mortality risk in older adults. We will publish estimates of the distribution of vitamin D intake and serum 25( OH) D concentration resulting from changes in vitamin D in the food supply, accounting for latitude, sun exposure and diet. Utilising advanced food production systems and targeted animal and human feeding studies, ODIN will propose safe, novel and effective food-based strategies to eradicate vitamin D deficiency that are inclusive, sustainable and affordable.","2015-09","2021-08-17 23:55:24","2021-08-17 23:55:24","","235-246","","3","40","","Nutrition Bulletin","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Adult; Europe; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Nutritional Requirements; Child; Child, Preschool; Pregnancy; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Age; Adolescence; Dietary Reference Intakes; Dietary Supplements -- Utilization; Dose-Response Relationship; Fetus; Food, Fortified; Government Programs -- Europe; Hypervitaminosis -- Risk Factors; Surveys -- Europe; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Diet Therapy; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Epidemiology -- Europe; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Ethnology; Vitamin D Deficiency -- In Pregnancy; Vitamin D Deficiency -- Prevention and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to conduct a contemporary population-based assessment of the prevalence, trends and factors associated with mental health disorders in individuals who are living in permanent residential aged care (PRAC) in Australia. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using national data from the Registry of Senior Australians, a national cohort of older Australians who had aged care eligibility assessment and entered PRAC between 2008 and 2016. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression modeling was applied to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. Results: Of 430,862 individuals included in this study, 57.8% had at least one mental health disorder. The prevalence of depression, phobia/anxiety and psychosis were as follows: 46.2% (95% confidence interval = [46.0%, 46.3%]), 14.9% (95% confidence interval = [14.8%, 15.0%]) and 9.7% (95% confidence interval = [9.6%, 9.8%]), respectively. The likelihood of having a mental health disorder was higher for those who were (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) relatively younger, specifically for every 10-year increment in age, the odds of having mental health disorders was 44.0% lower (0.56, [0.55, 0.56]); female (1.33 [1.32, 1.35]); having increasing numbers of physical health comorbidities, 6–10 (1.26 [1.24, 1.29]) or 11–15 (1.48 [1.45, 1.51]) or more than 15 (1.64 [1.58, 1.71]) compared to people having less than five comorbidities; having limitations related to health care tasks (1.05 [1.04, 1.07]), meals (1.04 [1.02, 1.05]) or social and community participation (1.10 [1.08, 1.12]). Conclusion: The burden of mental health disorders in older Australians living in PRAC was high and individuals with these conditions tend to be younger, with several physical comorbidities and/or functional limitations. Understanding the profile of individuals with mental health disorders at entry into PRAC can be used as evidence for baseline resource allocation for this population and evaluation of future needs of mental health services.","2020-12","2021-08-17 23:55:24","2021-08-17 23:55:24","","1200-1211","","12","54","","Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Thousand Oaks, California Publisher: Sage Publications Inc.","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Quality of Health Care; Prospective Studies; Australia; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; Multivariate Analysis; Health Services for the Aged; Cross Sectional Studies; Human; Healthy Aging; Social Determinants of Health; Comorbidity; Logistic Regression; Retrospective Design; Residential Care; Consumer Participation; Mental Disorders -- Epidemiology -- Australia; Mental Disorders -- Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examined the relationship between sensory-processing patterns and occupational engagement among older persons. Method. Participants were 180 people, ages 50 to 73 years, in good health, who lived in their homes. All participants completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile and the Activity Card Sort. Findings. Better registration of sensory input and greater sensory seeking were related to greater occupational engagement. Implications. Sensory-processing abilities among older persons and their relation to occupational engagement in various life settings should receive attention in research and practice. Occupational therapists should encourage older people to seek sensory input and provide them with rich sensory environments for enhancing meaningful engagement in real life.","2017-02","2021-08-17 23:55:25","2021-08-17 23:55:25","","10-21","","1","84","","Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Thousand Oaks, California Publisher: Sage Publications Inc.","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Analysis of Variance; Leisure Activities; Mental Processes; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; P-Value; Aging -- Physiology; Social Participation; Questionnaires; Middle Age; Clinical Assessment Tools; Physical Activity; Structural Equation Modeling; Data Analysis Software; Occupation (Human); Sensation -- Physiology; Sensory Stimulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Long-term prospective cohort study. Setting: Three academic medical centers. Participants: Individuals aged 70 and older (average age 77, 58% female) without recognized dementia scheduled for elective major surgery (N = 566). Measurements: Participants were assessed preoperatively, daily during hospitalization, and at variable monthly intervals for up to 36 months after discharge. Trained study staff assessed delirium in the hospital. Study outcomes included cognitive and physical function. Novel risk factors for delirium were assessed, including genetic and plasma biomarkers, neuroimaging markers, and cognitive reserve markers. Interrater reliability (kappa and weighted kappa) was assessed for critical variables in 119 of the participant interviews. Results: Eighty-one percent of participants were undergoing orthopedic surgery, and 24% developed delirium postoperatively. More than 95% of eligible participants were followed for 18 months. There was greater than 99% capture of important study outcomes (cognitive and functional status) at every study interview, and interrater reliability was high (weighted kappa for delirium = 0.92 and for overall cognitive and functional outcomes = 0.94-1.0). Completion rates were 95% to 99% for plasma biomarkers (4 time points) and 86% for neuroimaging (1-year follow-up). Conclusion:The SAGES study will contribute to the understanding of novel risk factors, pathophysiology and long-term outcomes of delirium.

The data used in the modelling were from a prospective 16-year longitudinal study of 1,000 older Australians. We examined predictors of trajectories for ageing well using self-rated health, psychological wellbeing and independence in daily living as joint indicators of ageing well in people aged over 65 years at baseline. We used group-trajectory modelling and multivariate regression to identify characteristics predicting ‘ageing well’. The results showed three distinct and sizeable ageing trajectory groups: (a) ‘stable-good ageing well’ (classified as ageing well in all longitudinal study waves; which was achieved by 30.2% of women and 28.0% of men); (b) ‘initially ageing well then deteriorating’ (50.5% women and 47.6% men); and (c) ‘stable-poor’ (not ageing well in any wave; 19.3% women and 24.4% men). Significant gender differences were found in membership in different ageing-well states. In the stable-poor groups there were 103/533 females which was significantly lower than 114/467 men (<italic>z</italic>-statistic = −2.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005); women had a ‘zero’ probability of progressing to a better ageing-well classification in later years, whilst males had a one-in-five probability of actually improving. Robust final state outcome predictors at baseline were lower age and fewer medical conditions for both genders; restful sleep and Australian-born for women; and good nutrition, decreased strain, non-smoker and good social support for men. These results support that ageing-well trajectories are influenced by modifiable factors. Findings will assist better targeting of health-promoting activities for older people.","2018-08","2021-08-17 23:55:25","2021-08-17 23:55:25","","1581-1602","","8","38","","Ageing & Society","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Nutritional Status; Sex Factors; Health Promotion; Prospective Studies; Activities of Daily Living; Age Factors; Australia; Multivariate Analysis; Smoking; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Sleep; Chronic Disease; Stress; Psychological Well-Being; Regression; Support, Psychosocial; Healthy Aging -- Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, graphs including data only from survivors may be misleading because they may confuse patterns of mortality with patterns of change in health. Two approaches for creating graphs that account for death in such situations are 1) to incorporate a category or value for death into the longitudinal health variable and 2) to measure time in years before death or some other event. The first approach has been applied to self-rated health (excellent to poor) and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). It allows for flexible and interpretable analyses and may be appropriate for other variables as well. The second approach also accounts fully for death, but the questions it can address are limited. Both approaches are useful and should be used at a minimum for supporting analyses in longitudinal studies in which persons die during observation.","2003-09-02","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-17 23:55:26","","416-420","","5","139","","Annals of Internal Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Publisher: American College of Physicians","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Death; Aging; Time Factors; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Funding Source; Human; Surveys; Geriatric Assessment -- Methods; Clinical Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: In 2007, MFUS began to study nutritional risk and its relation to successful aging of its study members. Three hundred and thirty-six survivors of the Manitoba Follow-up Study (MFUS) cohort with a mean age of 90.0 years (3.1 SD) from 2007-2011 were included in the analysis. Four years of nutritional risk data (five waves) from the MFUS survivor cohort were used to calculate latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Results: Of the participants, 66.7% were married, and 29.5% lived alone regardless of marital status. Five distinct developmental trajectories for nutrition risk score were identified [High-Increase (HI); High (H); Moderate-Increase (MI); Moderate (M); Low (L)]. Significant statistical differences were found between all groups for mental health (P = .02), physical health (P = <.001), perception of aging successfully (P = .04) and living alone (P = <.001). The five groups showed the most number of differences in appetite, intake of meat and alternatives, and vegetables and fruit, weight change, skipping meals and eating with others. Men in the HI group were two times more likely to die within a 2 1/2 year period compared to men in the L group (hazard rate = 2.33, P = .07). In terms of survival patterns, three distinct patterns emerged showing that of the men, 20% L, 30% MI and 50% HI died within 2 1/2 years. Implications and Conclusions: Poor nutritional risk score is associated with higher risk of mortality for very old men over a short period of time. Timely nutritional assessments by health professionals to identify older men at nutritional risk and subsequent nutrition education and follow-up are important in changing one's mortality trajectory.","2015-09","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-18 23:24:50","","e18-e18","","3","76","","Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice & Research","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Toronto, Ontario Publisher: Dietitians of Canada","","","","Aged; Male; Prospective Studies; Odds Ratio; Aged, 80 and Over; Descriptive Statistics; Health Status -- In Old Age; Human; P-Value; Comparative Studies; Manitoba; Mental Health -- In Old Age; Mortality -- In Old Age; Statistical Significance; Attitude to Aging; Diet -- In Old Age; Eating Behavior -- In Old Age; Men's Health -- In Old Age -- Manitoba; Nutrition Disorders -- Risk Factors -- In Old Age; Appetite -- In Old Age; Forecasting -- Manitoba; Marital Status -- In Old Age; Survival -- In Old Age -- Manitoba","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have suggested within-day distribution of protein intake plays a role in determining body composition remodeling. Here, we assessed whether changes in within-day protein intake distribution are related to improvements in body composition in overweight/obese older adults during a hypocaloric and exercise intervention. Methods: Thirty-six community-dwelling, overweight-to-obese (BMI 28.0-39.9 kg/m2), sedentary older adults (aged 70.6±6.1 years) were randomized into either physical activity plus successful aging health education (PA+SA; n=15) or physical activity plus weight loss (PA+WL; n=21) programs. Body composition (by CT and DXA) and dietary intake (by three-day food records) were determined at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits. Within-day protein distribution was calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) of protein ingested per defined time periods (breakfast [5:00−10:59], lunch [11:00−16:59] and dinner [17:00−1:00]). Secondary analysis was performed to determine associations between changes in protein intake distribution and body composition. Results: In both groups, baseline protein intake was skewed towards dinner (PA+SA: 49.1%; PA+WL: 54.1%). The pattern of protein intake changed towards a more even within-day distribution in PA+WL during the intervention period, but it remained unchanged in PA+SA. Transition towards a more even pattern of protein intake was independently associated with a greater decline in BMI (P<0.05) and abdominal subcutaneous fat (P<0.05) in PA+WL. However, changes in protein CV were not associated with changes in body weight in PA+SA. Conclusion: Our results show that mealtime distribution of protein intake throughout the day was associated with improved weight and fat loss under hypocaloric diet combined with physical activity. This finding provides a novel insight into the potential role of within-day protein intake on weight management in obese older people.","2020-02","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-17 23:55:26","","210-217","","2","24","","Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: , Publisher: Springer Nature","","","","Aged; Body Mass Index; Diet Records; Prospective Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Absorptiometry, Photon; Weight Loss; Meals; Health Education; Community Living; Secondary Analysis; Life Style, Sedentary; Random Assignment; Treatment Outcomes; Therapeutic Exercise -- Methods; Adipose Tissue Distribution -- Evaluation; Body Composition -- Evaluation; Dietary Proteins -- Therapeutic Use -- In Old Age; Energy Intake -- Standards; Obesity -- Diet Therapy -- In Old Age; Weight Reduction Programs -- Methods -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhance®Fitness is a low-cost group exercise program designed specifically for older adults (60+ years) to improve physical performance. The Hawai'i Healthy Aging Partnership, a statewide health promotion initiative, has continuously offered Enhance®Fitness to Hawai'i's multicultural population since 2007. This study examined 12-month participation in and impact of Enhance®Fitness on physical performance among older adults in Hawai'i. Method. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to analyze the physical performance measures (chair-stands, arm curls, and the up-and-go test) collected at baseline (month 0) and at 4, 8, and 12 months. We also compared the characteristics of participants who participated in the program for 12 months with those who dropped out in order to gain insights on participant retention. Results. Of 1,202 older adults with baseline data, 427 (35.5%) were continuously enrolled in Enhance®Fitness for 12 months and participated in follow-up data collection. On average, participants attended 63.7% of thrice-weekly classes each month. Participants' physical performance measures improved after 4 months, continued to improve until 8 months, and were maintained thereafter. Besides continuous attendance, performance-measure improvements were associated with younger age, male gender, living with others (vs. alone), and fewer chronic conditions. Compared to those who completed 12 months of the program, the 775 who left the program over the course of the year were more likely to be younger, to be Caucasian (vs. Asian or Pacific Islander), to self-report depression as a chronic condition, and to have lower levels of fitness at baseline. Common reasons for dropping out were illness, relocation, time conflicts, lost interest, and transportation issues. Conclusions. Long-term participants in Enhance®Fitness initially improved and then maintained physical performance. Future research is needed to identify strategies to maintain enrollment of older adults in the exercise programs over time.","2019-09-02","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-17 23:55:26","","1-7","","","","","Journal of Aging Research","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: London, Publisher: Hindawi Limited","","","","Aged; Physical Fitness; Female; Male; Sex Factors; Attitude to Health; Time Factors; Health Promotion; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Human; Chronic Disease; Hawaii; Linear Regression; Exercise Test; Quality Improvement; Consumer Participation -- In Old Age; Exercise Physiology -- In Old Age -- Hawaii; Group Exercise -- Methods -- In Old Age; Physical Performance -- Evaluation -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear mixed models examined the influence of UI on SPPB, adjusted by covariates (age, study site, education, income sufficiency, body mass index [BMI] and parity). Results: Women reporting some UI presented lower SPPB mean (β = −0.41, p =.009) and a greater reduction (β = −0.53, p =.001) over 2 years than those reporting no UI. Discussion: Compared with no reported UI, some UI was associated with worse and more pronounced declines in physical performance over 2 years. This study highlights the importance of practices to reduce UI to contribute to healthier aging.","2019-12","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-17 23:55:26","","1872-1891","","10","31","","Journal of Aging & Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Thousand Oaks, California Publisher: Sage Publications Inc.","","","","Aged; Female; Body Mass Index; Educational Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Women's Health; Prospective Studies; Age Factors; Descriptive Statistics; Human; Self Report; Healthy Aging; Clinical Assessment Tools; Linear Regression; Community Living -- In Old Age; Geographic Factors; Physical Performance -- In Old Age; Multimethod Studies; Parity; Urinary Incontinence -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A descriptive data analysis and a market basket analysis were conducted on de-identified nominal nursing intervention data from two home visits conducted by nurse practitioners (NPs) from October 2010 to June 2012 for 80 community-dwelling adults with developmental disabilities, ages 29 to 68 years. Results The mean number of NIC interventions was 4.7 in the first visit and 6.0 in the second visit and last visit. NPs reported 45 different intervention types as classified using a standardized language, with 376 in Visit One and 470 in Visit Two. Approximately 85% of the sample received the Health education intervention. The market basket analysis revealed common pairs, triples, and quadruple sets of interventions in this preventive model. The NIC nursing interventions that occurred together repeatedly were: Health education, Weight management, Nutrition management, Health screening, and Behavior management. Conclusions Five NIC interventions form the basis of an APRN-led preventive intervention model for individuals aging with lifelong disability, with health education as the most common intervention, combined with interventions to manage weight and nutrition, promote healthy behaviors, and encourage routine health screening. Less frequently reported NIC interventions suggest the need to tailor prevention to individual needs, whether acute or chronic. Clinical Relevance APRNs employing prevention among adults aging with developmental disabilities must anticipate the need to focus on health education strategies for health promotion and prevention as well as tailor and target a patient-centered approach to support self-management of health to promote healthy aging in place. These NIC interventions serve not only as a guide for planning preventive interventions, but for designing nursing curricula to reduce health disparities among people with varying learning needs.","2014-09","2021-08-17 23:55:26","2021-08-17 23:55:26","","304-313","","5","46","","Journal of Nursing Scholarship","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Malden, Massachusetts Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Female; Male; Aging; Prospective Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Human; Middle Age; Data Analysis Software; Descriptive Research; Convenience Sample; Home Health Care; Coding; Advanced Nursing Practice; Advanced Practice Nurses; Developmental Disabilities; Home Visits; Iowa Nursing Interventions Classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RESULTS: Within the CCRC, the Successful Aging construct discriminated participants with regard to ADL and IADL function and self-reported health status. In both WHAS-I and WHAS- II samples, the construct predicted functional ADL and IADL change over time, and in WHAS-I, it predicted hospitalizations.

Time between examination visits 1 (2004-2009) and 2 (2009-2013) ranged from <1 y to ∼8 y, with a mean ± SD of 4.64 ± 0.93 y. Latent class and haplotype analyses were conducted by creating gene polymorphism groups that were related to longitudinal annual rate of cognitive change predicted from mixed-effects regression models.Results: Among key findings, the rs3755166:G/A MEGALIN SNP was associated with faster decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination overall (β = -0.002, P = 0.018) and among women.

Water-loss dehydration is associated with poor health outcomes such as disability and mortality in older people. Urine specific gravity (USG), urine color, and urine osmolality have been widely advocated for screening for dehydration in older adults. Objective: We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of urinary measures to screen for water-loss dehydration in older people. Design: This was a diagnostic accuracy study of people aged ≥65 y taking part in the DRIE (Dehydration Recognition In our Elders; living in long-term care) or NU-AGE (Dietary Strategies for Healthy Ageing in Europe; living in the community) studies. The reference standard was serum osmolality, and index tests included USG, urine color, urine osmolality, urine cloudiness, additional dipstick measures, ability to provide a urine sample, and the volume of a random urine sample. Minimum useful diagnostic accuracy was set at sensitivity and specificity ≥70% or a receiver operating characteristic plot area under the curve ≥0.70. Results: DRIE participants (women: 67%; mean age: 86 y; n = 162) had more limited cognitive and functional abilities than did NUAGE participants (women: 64%; mean age: 70 y; n = 151). Nineteen percent of DRIE participants and 22% of NU-AGE participants were dehydrated (serum osmolality >300 mOsm/kg). Neither USG nor any other potential urinary tests were usefully diagnostic for water-loss dehydration. Conclusions: Although USG, urine color, and urinary osmolality have been widely advocated for screening for dehydration in older adults, we show, in the largest study to date to our knowledge, that their diagnostic accuracy is too low to be useful, and these measures should not be used to indicate hydration status in older people (either alone or as part of a wider tranche of tests). There is a need to develop simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive tools for the assessment of dehydration in older people. The DRIE study was registered at www.researchregister.org.uk as 122273. The NU-AGE trial was registered at clinicialtrials.gov as NCT01754012.","2016","2021-08-17 23:55:47","2021-08-17 23:55:47","","121-131","","1","104","","American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Sensitivity and Specificity; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Odds Ratio; United Kingdom; Reproducibility of Results; Aged, 80 and Over; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Funding Source; Geriatric Functional Assessment; Human; Validation Studies; ROC Curve; Clinical Assessment Tools; Interviews; Data Analysis Software; Barthel Index; Instrument Validation; Random Assignment; Randomized Controlled Trials; Body Mass Index -- In Old Age; Cognition -- In Old Age; Intervention Trials; Geriatric Nutrition; Activities of Daily Living -- In Old Age; Interrater Reliability; Color -- In Old Age; Dehydration -- Diagnosis -- In Old Age; Fluid-Electrolyte Balance -- In Old Age; Osmolar Concentration -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Refractometry; Serum -- Analysis -- In Old Age; Specific Gravity -- Evaluation -- In Old Age; Urinalysis -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional physical activity interventions do not consider the specific needs and views of older adults. As views on ageing are known to be related to health behaviours, the current study evaluates the effectiveness of prompting positive views on ageing within a physical activity intervention. Design: Randomised controlled trial with three groups aged 65+: Intervention for physical activity with ‘views-on-ageing’-component (n = 101; IGVoA), and without ‘views-on-ageing’-component (n = 30; IG), and active control intervention for volunteering (n = 103; CG). Main outcome measures: Attitudes towards older adults and physical activity were assessed five weeks before intervention, two weeks, six weeks and 8.5 months after the intervention. Results: Compared to the IG and CG, positive attitudes towards older adults increased in the IGVoA after the intervention. For IGVoA, the indirect intervention effect on change in activity via change in attitudes towards older adults was reliable. Conclusion: A ‘views-on-ageing’-component within a physical activity intervention affects change in physical activity via change in views on ageing. Views on ageing are a promising intervention technique to be incorporated into future physical activity interventions for older adults.","2014-08","2021-08-17 23:55:47","2021-08-17 23:55:47","","915-932","","8","29","","Psychology & Health","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Oxfordshire, Publisher: Routledge","","","","Aged; Female; Male; Aging; Prospective Studies; Confidence Intervals; Germany; Chi Square Test; Descriptive Statistics; Health Behavior -- In Old Age; Human; Multiple Regression; Stereotyping; Questionnaires; Interviews; Coefficient Alpha; Data Analysis Software; Attitude to Aging; Physical Activity -- In Old Age; Randomized Controlled Trials; Hypothesis; Life Style, Sedentary -- In Old Age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine these relationships from both between- and within-person perspectives. Methods: Older adults (n = 116) ranging in age from 60 to 90 (M = 64.71) completed a 9-day daily diary study online, resulting in 743 total days. Participants reported their sociodemographic characteristics on Day 1 and physical symptoms, memory failures, felt age, daily AARC gain and loss experiences, and control beliefs on Days 2–9. Results Within-person deviations from one's typical awareness of aging (AARC losses, AARC gains, and subjective age) were associated with fluctuations in control beliefs. Multilevel mediation results showed that between-person AARC losses mediated the relationship between health (both physical symptoms and memory failures) and control beliefs, whereas both within- and between-person control beliefs mediated the relationship between physical health and AARC losses. Model fit comparisons showed that models with control beliefs mediating health and awareness of aging fit better than models with awareness of aging mediating health and control beliefs. Discussion Our findings suggest that within-person physical and cognitive health indicators were associated with awareness of aging indirectly through control beliefs. Although between-person differences in AARC losses may link health and control beliefs, our results suggest that a more consistent pattern involves control beliefs linking health and awareness of aging.","2021-05","2021-08-17 23:55:48","2021-08-17 23:55:48","","858-870","","5","76","","Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","CINAHL with Full Text","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","","","Aged; Cognition; Aging; Health Behavior; Memory; Prospective Studies; Aged, 80 and Over; Human; Healthy Aging; Middle Age; Gerontologic Care; Health Beliefs; Attitude to Aging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this is accompanied with an increasing burden of age-associated diseases, it also emphasizes the need to understand the effects of healthy aging on cognitive processes. One such effect is a general slowing of processing speed, which is well documented in many domains. The execution of anti-saccades depends on a well-established brain-wide network ranging from various cortical areas and basal ganglia through the superior colliculus down to the brainstem saccade generators. To clarify the consequences of healthy aging as well as gender on the execution of reflexive and voluntary saccades, we measured a large sample of healthy, non-demented individuals (n = 731, aged 51-84 years) in the anti-saccade task. Age affected various aspects of saccade performance: The number of valid trials decreased with age. Error rate, saccadic reaction times (SRTs), and variability in saccade accuracy increased with age, whereas anti-saccade costs, accuracy, and peak velocity of anti-saccades and direction errors were not affected by age. Gender affected SRTs independent of age and saccade type with male participants having overall shorter SRTs. Our rigid and solid statistical testing using linear mixed-effect models provide evidence for a uniform slowing of processing speed independent of the actually performed eye movement. Our data do not support the assumption of a specific deterioration of frontal lobe functions with aging.

We sought to determine: 1) whether MPA to AAo ratio (MPA:AAo) varies with sex and age in healthy adults; 2) normal upper 90th percentile (P90) values for MPA:AAo; 3) effect of age on MPA:AAo in the general population., Methods: 1794 adults from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort (65+/-9 y, 47% men) underwent ECG-gated T2-weighted black blood aortic CMR at 1.5T. MPA and AAo diameters were measured at MPA bifurcation level or the adjacent slice. A referent group free of hypertension, LV focal wall motion abnormality, any history of smoking, asthma, COPD, DVT and obesity was identified and stratified by sex and age group (<55, 55-64, 65-74, >=75 y). Data are summarized as mean+/-SD. P90 values were determined from referent participants. We tested for sex differences by 2-sample t test and for within-sex trend across age groups using linear regression., Results: Of the 1794 Offspring, 370 met referent group criteria, among whom men had greater MPA (23.4+/-2.9 vs 21.3+/-3.1 mm, p<0.0001) and AAo (31.1+/-2.9 vs 28.5+/-3.1 mm, p< 0.0001) diameters than women, but height-indexed AAo/HT (p=0.60) and MPA/HT (p=0.33) were not different between sexes. MPA:AAo did not differ between sexes, men=0.76+/-0.10, women: 0.75+/-0.15, p=0.97. P90 values for MPA:AAo were 0.88 (men) and 0.87 (women). MPA:AAo significantly decreased with age in both sexes (see Table) due to increasing AAo; MPA did not vary with age. In the overall population MPA:AAo also decreased with greater age, but here both AAo and MPA tended to increase with advancing age., Conclusions: Among healthy adults free of hypertension, obesity, and common pulmonary risk factors, MPA:AAo ratio does not differ between sexes. In healthy aging MPA:AAo decreases with age in both sexes, due to increased AAo diameters.

Therefore, the normal reference ranges obtained from the healthy Asians are important for clinical utility of echocardiography in Asia., Methods: Population-based echocardiography dataset from 6,023 healthy ethnic Asians (47.1+/-10.9 years, 61.3% men) were divided into 6 age decades: <=29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and >=70 years. We explored age- and sex-related structural/functional alterations according to 2016 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) diastolic dysfunction (DD) criteria and their correlates with clinical N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) cut-off for heart failure (HF). Racial comparisons were made using data from London Life Sciences Prospective Population (LOLIPOP) study., Results: Age- and sex-based normative reference ranges (including mean, median, 10% and 90% lower and upper reference values) were extracted from our large healthy population. In fully adjusted models, advanced age (treated as linear) was independently associated with cardiac structural remodeling and worsened diastolic parameters: larger indexed LA volume (LAVi), lower e', higher E/e', and higher TR velocity; all p<0.001), and were broadly more prominent in women (P interaction: <0.05). in general, markedly lower e', higher E/e' and smaller LAVi were observed in ethnic Asians compared to Whites. DD defined by 2016 ASE criteria, despite at low prevalence (0.42%) in current healthy population, increased drastically with advanced age and performed perfectly in excluding abnormal NT-proBNP (>=125 pg/ml) (Specificity: 99.8%, NPV: 97.6%)., Conclusions: This is to date the largest cohort exploring the normative reference values using guideline-centered diastolic parameters from healthy Asians, with senescence process played as central role in diastolic dysfunction.

We describe the HAS distribution in a cohort of HIV-positive adults and correlate it with health outcomes., Design: A cross-sectional pilot study of 101 adults aged at least 40 years, on suppressive antiretroviral therapy attending a tertiary HIV clinic in Toronto, Canada., Methods: Participants completed questionnaires to calculate their HAS (range 0-14). Demographics, HAS and sub-scores were compared by age and sex. The HAS was compared with results of the Fried Frailty Score, Short Performance Physical Battery score (SPPB) and measures of health utilization. Kruskal--Wallis Rank-Sum and Fisher's exact tests were used for all comparisons., Results: Median (IQR) age was 56 (50--62), 81 (80%) men and 50 (50%) born in Canada. Median (IQR) CD4+ cell count was 574 (417--794) cells/[mu]l. Median (IQR) HAS was 12 (10--13) with 39 (39%) achieving a score more than 12 (considered healthy aging). Younger participants experienced more depression, whereas women had greater pain. The HAS score correlated with the Fried Frailty Score (P = 0.008) and trended with the SPPB Score (P = 0.077). Those with the poorest HAS scores were more likely to have been hospitalized in the preceding 6 months (P = 0.034)., Conclusion: The HAS ranged from 5 to 14 in this cohort of older HIV adults with 39% attaining scores in the 'healthy' range.

Frailty, an independent predictor of fractures and decreased bone mineral density is associated with altered bone metabolism in women. However, no previous works have studied the relationship among frailty, Hcy levels and bone turnover., Methods: We studied the association among Hcy, osteoporosis and N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ([beta]-CTX), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in 631 Spanish women between the ages of 65-78 from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA) cohort, who were classified as highly functional (robust subjects) or non-robust (pre-frail or frail subjects) according to Fried's criteria., Results: Hcy was independently associated with [beta]-CTX in the entire population (B=0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.34; p=0.001) and in the non-robust group (B=0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.39; p=0.002). Hcy was also associated with PINP in the entire and non-robust populations, but the association was lost after including the levels of [beta]-CTX, but not the other bone biomarkers, in the multivariate analysis. This suggests that the controversial relationship between Hcy and bone formation might be explained, at least to a certain extent, by the confounding effects of [beta]-CTX., Conclusions: This work highlights the important implication of frailty status in the association between Hcy and increased bone turnover in older women., HIGHLIGHTS:, * Homocysteine is independently associated with bone resorption in older women., * Frailty is implicated in the association between homocysteine and bone resorption., * Bone resorption takes part in the association of homocysteine with bone formation., (C) 2018Elsevier, Inc.","2018-07","2021-08-18 18:31:16","2021-08-18 18:31:16","","201-208","","","108","","","","","","","","","","English.","","","","","Journals@Ovid","00080475-201807150-00027","Institution: (a)Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, IBIS (Universidad de Sevilla, HUVR, Junta de Andalucia, CSIC), Sevilla, Spain, (b)Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain, (c)Departamento de Bioquimica Medica y Biologia Molecular e Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain, (d)Division of Geriatric Medicine, Hospital Virgen del Valle, Complejo Hospitalario de Toledo, Toledo, Spain, (e)Servicio de Geriatria y Fundacion para la Investigacion Biomedica, Hospital Universitario de Getafe Madrid, Spain","","","","Homocysteine; Frailty; Biochemical markers of bone turnover; Osteoporosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[Abstract]","Circulation","","0009-7322","","","Introduction: As obesity rates rise, it is increasingly important to understand obesity-related health behaviors, including physical activity (PA). Less is known about the role of perceived neighborhood environment, particularly perceptions of crime and violence, in preventing PA., Hypothesis: Unfavorable neighborhood perception is associated with lower PA levels, and may be moderated by socioeconomic status (SES)., Methods: Within the multiracial, socioeconomically diverse HANDLS cohort, we examined the association between self-reported neighborhood perception (Likert-scale questions) and physical activity (Baecke PA questionnaire). Factor analysis identified key neighborhood characteristics to develop a total neighborhood perception score (NPS), which was divided into quintiles for analysis. Higher NPS indicated less favorable neighborhood perception. Linear regression was used to determine the relationship between total NPS, factor scores, and PA., Results: In Wave 4 [n=2167; mean age 56.6(9.1) years, 58.6% female, 61.1% black, 40.5% below poverty line], we identified five neighborhood perception factors: 1) concern about specific crime types 2) physical environment, 3) violent crime, 4) social environment and 5) violence beyond the neighborhood. Across NPS quintiles, those in quintile 5 were more likely to be younger (p < 0.001), white (p < 0.001), above the poverty level (p < 0.001), and more highly educated (p < 0.001), but less likely to be smokers (p = 0.05) or engage in leisure time PA (p < 0.001). Total PA decreased with increasing NPS in Factor 4 across all race/sex groups and with total NPS for white females. Total PA increased with increasing NPS in Factor 3 for white males. The NPS-PA relationship was not moderated by SES., Conclusions: Poor perceived social cohesion is associated with decreasing PA, while - paradoxically - increased perceived violent crime is associated with higher PA for white males.

However, very few studies have examined its relation with multidimensional concepts of healthy aging (HA). Our objective was thus to investigate the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet at midlife and HA. Methods: We analyzed data from 3,012 participants of the French SUpplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) study aged 45-60 years at baseline (1994-1995) and initially free of major chronic diseases, with available data on HA status in 2007-2009. We defined HA as not developing major chronic disease (cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes), good physical and cognitive functioning (evaluated by validated, standardized tests), independence in instrumental activities of daily living, no depressive symptoms, good social functioning, good self-perceived health, and no function-limiting pain. An index assessing adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the Literature-based Adherence Score to the Mediterranean Diet (LAMD) was calculated using baseline data from repeated 24-hour dietary records. Results: In 2007-2009, 38% of participants met the HA criteria. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that higher scores on the LAMD (ORTertile 3 vs Tertile 1: 1.36 [1.12; 1.65]) were associated with higher odds of HA. Supplementary analyses using structural equation modeling revealed a potential mediation of the observed associations by metabolic health-related factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest a favorable role of a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet at midlife for maintaining good overall health during aging.

[Abstract]","Circulation","","0009-7322","","","Background: The American Heart Association (AHA) has developed the Life's Simple 7 metric (no smoking, high levels of physical activity, normal body mass index, no hypertension, no diabetes, no hyperlipidemia, healthy diet) to track behaviors and risk factors associated with cardiovascular health (CVH). Given the potential role that CVH has in cognition and psychological well-being, we aimed to study the association of the Life's Simple 7 with cognitive function, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Emory Health Aging Study (EHAS)., Methods: EHAS is an ongoing cohort study with the overall goal of understanding determinants of healthy aging in the general population. Participants 18 years of age or older are recruited at primary care clinics, community events, and through social media, primarily from the Atlanta (GA) area. Information on sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race, education, income), anthropometrics (weight, height), lifestyles (smoking, physical activity), and clinical variables (history of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease [CVD]) was collected through online questionnaires. Life's Simple 7 score (excluding diet; information not available) was defined based on self-reported data, giving 1 point per achieved metric [range 0 (lowest)-6(highest CVH)]. Neurobehavioral variables were measured using validated scales (Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI), range 0-14, for cognition; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8, range 0-24, for depressive symptoms; Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) questionnaire, range 0-21, for anxiety; higher scores represent worse function/symptoms). Cross-sectional associations between Life's Simple 7 score and these scales were assessed using multivariable linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic variables., Results: We included 3,774 participants [mean age (standard deviation, SD) 58 (13), 79% women, 84% white, 9% African American, 7% other) free of self-reported CVD, recruited between October 2015 and October 2016. Levels of CVH in the cohort were relatively high, with 62% participants meeting at least 4 health criteria [mean (SD) score 3.9 (1.3)]. The mean (SD) of CFI, PHQ-8, and GAD were 1.9 (2.1), 3.2 (3.8), 2.4 (3.4), respectively. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and income, higher values of Life's Simple 7 score were related to better cognitive function and lower levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety: estimates (95% confidence interval) per 1-point in Life's Simple 7 score were -0.16 (-0.22, -0.11) for CFI, -0.5 (-0.6, -0.4) for PHQ-8, and -0.3 (-0.4, -0.2) for GAD., Conclusion: Higher levels of CVH, as assessed with the AHA Life's Simple 7, were cross-sectionally associated with a beneficial neurobehavioral profile.

[Abstract]","Circulation","","0009-7322","","","Background: Family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a readily available risk indicator of future CVD, combining the influence of shared genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Though CVD risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and decline, less is known about the association between family history of CVD and cognitive function. Evaluating this association may further elucidate the role of cardiovascular health in cognitive health., Methods: The Emory Healthy Aging Study isan ongoing prospective cohort study aimed at identifying predictors of healthy aging and age-related diseases. Participants are primarily residents of the Atlanta area, at least 18 years old, who completed an online baseline health survey. Multiple recruitment forums were used, including clinic waiting rooms, informational letters and emails, community events and online recruitment. Baseline information about demographic (age, race, gender), socioeconomic (education, household income), and health behavior factors (physical activity, smoking) as well as personal health (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension) and family health history were collected by online survey. Family history of CVD was defined as self-reported history for any parent or sibling of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Cognitive function was measured using the validated Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) with scores ranging between 0-14 (lower is better). The association between family history of CVD and CFI score was assessed using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and CVD risk factors, as well as family history of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD)., Results: We studied 3801 participants (75% female, 85% white, 10% black, and 5% other), recruited between October 2015 and October 2016. Mean age was 59+/-13 years and 61% reported a family history of CVD. Adjusting for age, gender, race, education, household income, exercise habits, smoking status and family history of MCI or AD, family history of CVD was associated with poorer cognitive performance ([beta]=0.26; 95% CI (0.12, 0.41)). Additional adjustment for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and BMI only slightly attenuated estimates ([beta]=0.22; 95% CI (0.08, 0.41)). In the same model, the estimated [beta] for family history of cognitive impairment was similar: 0.22 (0.07, 0.37)., Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study of people from the community, family history of CVD was associated with poorer cognitive function, and this association was of the same magnitude as having a first-degree family member with a history of cognitive impairment. Although longitudinal data are needed, these results underscore the link between cardiovascular and neurocognitive health and potential role of shared genetic and behavioral factors., (C) 2017  by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, Inc.","2017-03","2021-08-18 18:31:16","2021-08-18 19:18:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English.","","","","","Journals@Ovid","00003017-201703071-00084","Institution: Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[Miscellaneous Article]","Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition & Metabolic Care","","1363-1950","10.1097/MCO.0000000000000318","","Purpose of review: There is great interest in developing tools to measure healthy ageing and to identify early stages of health impairment, which may guide the implementation of interventions to prevent or delay the development of disease, disability, and mortality. Here, we review the most recent developments directed to operationalize, and test, definitions of healthy ageing., Recent findings: There is lack of consensus about how to define healthy ageing and, unsurprisingly, diversity in the instruments for its measurement. However, progress is being made in describing and in devising tools to capture the healthy ageing phenotype. Attempts to measure healthy ageing have relied primarily on cross-sectional data collected in older people. More recent studies have assessed the healthy ageing phenotype using markers of multiple functional domains and have used longitudinal data to model the dynamics and trajectories of healthy ageing., Summary: Given the complexity of the ageing process, no single measure is able to predict the ageing trajectory. Current attempts to operationalize the healthy ageing phenotype have relied on markers and data from earlier cohort studies and are limited by the tools used to collect data in those studies. Such data are often unsuitable to detect early subtle declines in function and/or are inappropriate for use in younger old adults. Future studies employing more objective and novel markers of healthy ageing are likely to offer opportunities to define and operationalize the healthy ageing phenotype., Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We sought to determine the prevalence and regional variation of CKD and the relationship of biologic and socio-economic factors to CKD risk in the older-adult population of Costa Rica., METHODS: We used data from the Costa Rican Longevity and Health Aging Study (CRELES). The cohort was comprised of 2657 adults born before 1946 in Costa Rica, chosen through a sampling algorithm to represent the national population of Costa Ricans >60 years of age. Participants answered questionnaire data and completed laboratory testing. The primary outcome of this study was CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2., RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of CKD for older Costa Ricans was 20% (95% CI 18.5-21.9%). In multivariable logistic regression, older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.08 per year, 95% CI 1.07-1.10, P < 0.001) was independently associated with CKD. For every 200 m above sea level of residence, subjects' odds of CKD increased 26% (aOR 1.26 95% CI 1.15-1.38, P < 0.001). There was large regional variation in adjusted CKD prevalence, highest in Limon (40%, 95% CI 30-50%) and Guanacaste (36%, 95% CI 26-46%) provinces. Regional and altitude effects remained robust after adjustment for socio-economic status., CONCLUSIONS: We observed large regional and altitude-related variations in CKD prevalence in Costa Rica, not explained by the distribution of traditional CKD risk factors.

But do they also predict a broad concept of ""active and healthy aging"" (""successful aging"")? We studied this in our long-term cohort., Methods: The Helsinki Businessmen Study is a follow-up study of socioeconomically homogenous cohort of men born 1919-1934 (n=3293). Midlife (average age 42 years) risk factors included BMI, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, and one-hour glucose. Total CVD risk was also assessed with Keys' risk score including age, BMI, smoking, cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. Mortality follow-up was through 2010 whereupon mailed questionnaire data, including lifestyle, diseases, and quality of life was obtained from survivors. As there is no consensus criteria on active and healthy aging, our definition included the following 6 criteria which in general could be considered important: survival to an average age of 82 years, and 5 dimensions related to health, wellbeing, and physical, cognitive, and social functioning. In the analyses we divided the cohort into 3 age groups: men born 1919-1924 (n=969), 1925-1929 (n=1481), and 1930-1934 (n=843)., Results: By 2010, 1788 of the midlife cohort had died and 894 (59% of survivors) responded to mailed questionnaire survey. According to our definition, only 154 men (4.8%) of the whole cohort experienced active and healthy aging fulfilling all 6 criteria. Of the individual midlife CVD risk factors only higher systolic blood pressure reduced odds of active and healthy aging (OR per SD 0.65. 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82, P<0.001) in adjusted analyses. Keys' score was a powerful predictor of active and healthy aging overall (OR per SD of log value: 0.49, 95% CI 0.41-0.60, P<0.001), and in all age groups. ORs were: 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.95 (P=0.03); 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.72 (P<0.001), and 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.92 (P=0.01) in the oldest, middle and youngest age group, respectively., Conclusions: From a life-course viewpoint, active and healthy aging was relatively infrequent among men of higher social class. Lower systolic blood pressure and CVD risk overall in early midlife strongly predicted active and healthy aging giving impetus to controlling CVD risk in time in aging societies., (C) 2015  by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association, Inc.","2015-11","2021-08-18 18:31:16","2021-08-18 19:18:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English.","","","","","Journals@Ovid","00003017-201511103-00562","Institution: (1)Medicine, Univ of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, (2)Neurology, Univ of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone markers have been related to both aging and fractures. However, no previous reports have shown a potential relationship between serum bone markers such as N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen ([beta]-CTX) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with frailty in elderly female populations. This study is aimed at examining the associations of bone metabolism markers and frailty in older Spanish women through a descriptive cross-sectional analysis based on a cohort of the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (TSHA). The levels of serum PINP, [beta]-CTX, PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were assessed in 592 participants (median age 74 years) who were defined as robust, prefrail and frail according to Fried's approach. Frail subjects had significantly high levels of PINP, [beta]-CTX and PTH and low production of 25(OH)D. After adjustment for confounders, high PINP levels (defined by the upper quartile) and low levels of 25(OH)D (lower quartile) remained significantly associated to frailty [OR for PINP: 2.19 (95% CI, 1.15-4.18; P = 0.017); OR for 25(OH)D: 1.65 (95% CI, 1.02-2.67; P = 0.042)]. Women with both high PINP levels and low 25(OH)D levels presented a 5.85-fold increased frailty risk (95% CI, 1.64-20.93; P = 0.007). The main contribution of this paper is the novel definition of PINP and 25(OH)D markers as potential biomarkers of frailty and targets for intervention., Highlights:, * Frail and prefrail old Spanish women have high levels of serum PINP, [beta]-CTX and PTH., * Prefrail and frail old Spanish women have lower 25(OH)D levels than non-frail women., * High P1NP levels are associated with high frailty prevalence., * Low 25(OH)D levels are associated with frailty (OR, 1.65; 95% CI: 1.02-2.67)., * Women with high PINP and low 25(OH)D levels have a 5.85-fold increased frailty risk., (C) 2015Elsevier, Inc.","2015-09","2021-08-18 18:31:16","2021-08-18 18:31:16","","79-84","","","","","","","","","","","","","English.","","","","","Journals@Ovid","00080475-201509001-00011","Institution: (a) Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital (IBiS/CSIC/SAS/University of Seville), Seville, Spain, (b) Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Immunology, University of Seville School of Medicine, Seville, Spain, (c) Division of Geriatric Medicine, Hospital Virgen del Valle, Complejo Hospitalario de Toledo, Toledo, Spain, (d) Servicio de Geriatria y Fundacion para la Investigacion Biomedica, Hospital Universitario de Getafe Madrid, Spain","","","","Frailty; Vitamin D; Bone markers; PINP; PTH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a genome-wide association study and a genome-wide linkage analysis to map quantitative trait loci associated with the HAI and a modified HAI weighted for mortality risk in 3,140 individuals selected for familial longevity from the Long Life Family Study. The genome-wide association study used the Long Life Family Study as the discovery cohort and individuals from the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Framingham Heart Study as replication cohorts., Results. There were no genome-wide significant findings from the genome-wide association study; however, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms near ZNF704 on chromosome 8q21.13 were suggestively associated with the HAI in the Long Life Family Study (p < 10- 6) and nominally replicated in the Cardiovascular Health Study and Framingham Heart Study. Linkage results revealed significant evidence (log-odds score = 3.36) for a quantitative trait locus for mortality-optimized HAI in women on chromosome 9p24-p23.

A cohort of elderly individuals were classified according to their level of memory preservation and administered a test of episodic memory in which participants were cued to learn or simply read each word and then to identify previously presented items in a delayed recognition phase. Mathematical modelling revealed that relatively preserved memory function was specifically linked to a faster rate of memorial evidence accumulation (drift rate). Analysis of event-related potentials at encoding revealed that high-performing elderly exhibited signals over parietal regions that discriminated between words to be learned vs. read for an additional 300-ms compared to young subjects suggesting a compensatory encoding mechanism that was absent in the low-performing group. At recognition, parietal signals associated with recollection processes discriminated previously learned words from read words in the young and high-performing old but not in low-performing old. These results reveal that successful aging is associated with specific adaptive neural markers during both encoding and retrieval.

We examined the ability to perform multiple IADL tasks in relation to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) defined on purely neuropsychological grounds. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Population-based cohort in southwestern Pennsylvania. Participants: One thousand seven hundred thirty-seven community-dwelling adults age 65 years and older. Measurements: Classification of MCI based on performance with reference to norms in the cognitive domains of memory, language, attention, executive, and visuospatial functions. The ability to perform seven IADL tasks (traveling, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework, taking medications, handling personal finances, and using the telephone) as assessed by the Older Americans Resources and Services scale. Results: Those with cognitively defined MCI were more likely to be dependent in at least one IADL task, as well as in each individual IADL task, than cognitively normal participants. Better memory and executive functioning were associated with lower odds of IADL dependence in MCI. Across the subtypes of MCI, those with the multiple-domain amnestic subtype were most likely to be dependent in all IADL tasks, with better executive functioning associated with lower risk of dependence in select IADL tasks in this group. Conclusions: Mild impairment in cognition is associated with difficulty performing IADL tasks at the population level. Understanding these associations may help improve prediction of the outcomes of MCI. It may also allow appropriate targeting of cognitive interventions in MCI to potentially help preserve functional independence.

[Miscellaneous Article]","Journal of Clinical Endocrinology","","0021-972X","10.1210/jc.2012-1271","","Background: Adverse effects of higher endogenous estradiol (E2) levels on various clinical outcomes and on determinants of the frailty syndrome have recently been reported. However, there are no data about the potential relationship between E2 and frailty. We aimed to study the association between E2 levels and frailty among older postmenopausal women not taking hormonal therapy., Methods: We used data from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging, a Spanish population-based cohort study. Frailty was defined according to Fried's approach. Multivariate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with E2 levels were estimated using polytomous logistic regression., Results: E2 levels decreased significantly with age and educational level, whereas they increased with body mass index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and impairment in Katz activities of daily living. Higher E2 levels were associated with the prevalence of frailty among women younger than 79 yr, but not in the oldest group (p interaction = 0.047). After adjustment, OR of frailty associated with a 1 SD increase of E2 was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.04-2.20; P = 0.03). We identified an interaction between E2 and hs-CRP on the prevalence of frailty (P value = 0.042). Women with both higher E2 and hs-CRP (defined as values into the upper tertile) had an age-adjusted OR of 4.2 (95% CI, 1.7-10.5; P = 0.002), compared with women with low levels of both E2 and hs-CRP., Conclusion: Higher E2 levels were associated with frailty in postmenopausal women.

To identify frailty subdimensions, factor analysis was conducted using the CHS variables and an expanded set including the CHS variables, cognitive impairment, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), subjective weakness, and anorexia. Participants with four or more of 10 criteria were classified as having an expanded frailty phenotype. Predictive validity of each identified frailty subdimension was assessed using regression models for 4-year disability and 9-year mortality., RESULTS: Two subdimensions of the CHS phenotype and four subdimensions of the expanded frailty phenotype were identified. Cognitive function was consistently part of a subdimension including slower gait, weaker grip, and lower physical activity. The CHS subdimension of slower gait, weaker grip, and lower physical activity predicted disability (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.3-2.2) and mortality (AOR=1.5, 95% CI=1.3-1.8).

Design: A longitudinal, British civil service-based cohort study. Participants were followed for 17 years to assess successful aging. This was defined as being free of major disease and in the top tertile of physical and cognitive functioning measured in 2002 to 2004. Setting: Twenty London-based Civil Service departments. Participants: Four thousand, one hundred forty men and 1,823 women, free of major disease at baseline in 1985 to 1988 (mean age 44, range 35-55). Measurements: Behavioral, biological, and psychosocial risk factors; physical and cognitive functioning; and disease outcomes. Results: Five hundred forty eight (12.8%) men and 246 (14.6%) women were successfully aging at follow-up. Midlife socioeconomic position strongly predicted this (age adjusted odds ratio, highest vs lowest = 7.1, 95% CI = 3.4-14.6, for men and 7.7, 95% CI = 4.9-12.1, for women). Height, education (in men), not smoking, diet, exercise, moderate alcohol (in women), and work support (in men) were related to a favorable older life after adjustment for age and socioeconomic position.

The Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 had their mental ability assessed at age 11 and 79. Almost 500 participants also rated their life satisfaction, social networks, and support at age 80. After controlling for age-11 IQ, sex, years of education, and social class, loneliness was the only social network/support characteristic adding significantly to the prediction of age-79 IQ, explaining about 2% of the variance; in old age, increased loneliness was associated with lower cognitive ability. Social network/support factors accounted for 23% of the variance in satisfaction with life ratings, with the greatest contributions from reduced loneliness (~12%) and having someone to talk to (~6%). Social network/support characteristics explained a greater proportion of the variance in life satisfaction ratings compared with later life cognition, although an individual's level of loneliness emerged as the largest single social support predictor of both outcomes. Possible causal pathways for these associations, which need to be studied in future research, are discussed.

The low caloric intake, long life expectancy, and the high prevalence of centenarians in Okinawa have been used as an argument to support the CR hypothesis in humans. However, no long-term, epidemiologic analysis has been conducted on traditional dietary patterns, energy balance, and potential CR phenotypes for the specific cohort of Okinawans who are purported to have had a calorically restricted diet. Nor has this cohort's subsequent mortality experience been rigorously studied. Therefore, we investigated six decades of archived population data on the elderly cohort of Okinawans (aged 65-plus) for evidence of CR. Analyses included traditional diet composition, energy intake, energy expenditure, anthropometry, plasma DHEA, mortality from age-related diseases, and current survival patterns. Findings include low caloric intake and negative energy balance at younger ages, little weight gain with age, life-long low BMI, relatively high plasma DHEA levels at older ages, low risk for mortality from age-related diseases, and survival patterns consistent with extended mean and maximum life span.

In view of the aging population, it is important to know the long-term prognosis of CIAP., Objectives: To determine if CIAP is influenced by the superposition of the effects of aging and to evaluate the severity of CIAP according to the disease duration., Design: Controlled cohort study., Setting: Outpatient clinic for neuromuscular diseases at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands., Participants and Methods: One hundred twenty-seven patients with CIAP and 108 age-matched control subjects were included. We defined CIAP on the basis of symmetrical distal sensory or sensorimotor symptoms and signs with evolution over at least 6 months, exclusion of causes by history taking, results of clinical and laboratory investigations, and electrophysiologic findings that agreed with the diagnosis of axonal polyneuropathy., Results: No important neurologic or electrophysiologic differences were found between patients with early-onset (before the age of 65 years) and late-onset (at or after the age of 65 years) CIAP, but patients with early-onset CIAP who had a short disease duration (<10 years) experienced more disability than patients with late-onset CIAP who had a similar disease duration. Old controls (age of 65 years or older) more often had symptoms, sensory signs in the legs, absent ankle jerks, and lower mean distal amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials than young controls (aged <65 years). Absence of the sural nerve sensory nerve action potentials or presence of spontaneous muscle fiber activity in the anterior tibial muscle was common in patients with CIAP (51% and 60%, respectively), but exceptional (both 2%) in controls., Conclusions: Neither aging of the peripheral nervous system nor disease duration affects CIAP to a considerable degree, but CIAP has a greater influence on the daily life of nonretired patients with early-onset CIAP.

Increasing age is a risk factor for the development of many illnesses, and sexual dimorphism influences brain anatomy, function, and cognition. Here, we examine frequency-specific connectivity in resting-state networks in a large sample (n = 406) of healthy aged adults. Method: We quantify frequency-specific connectivity in three resting-state networks known to be implicated in age-related decline: the default mode, dorsal attention, and salience networks, using multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging. Frequency-specific connectivity was quantified in four bands: low (0.015-0.027 Hz), moderately low (0.027-0.073 Hz), moderately high (0.073-0.198 Hz), and high (0.198-0.5 Hz) frequency bands, using mean intensity and spatial extent. Differences in connectivity between the sexes in each of the three networks were examined. Results: Each network showed the largest intensity and spatial extent at low frequencies and smallest extent at high frequencies. Males showed greater connectivity than females in the salience network. Females showed greater connectivity than males in the default mode network. Discussion: Results in this healthy aged cohort are compatible with those obtained in young samples, suggesting that frequency-specific connectivity, and differences between the sexes, are maintained into older age. Our results indicate that sex should be considered as an influencing factor in studies of resting-state connectivity.

Consequently the provision of healthcare for older people is increasingly important. Central to that healthcare is to help people to make good lifestyle decisions as they get older to keep themselves as healthy and happy for as long as possible. But what are those lifestyle decisions? Are they the usual suspects (exercise, diet, socialising, avoiding cigarettes and excess alcohol)? What is the evidence that they work? How can we as healthcare professionals help our patients make these good decisions? This chapter addresses these questions. It starts with some background. It discusses the more prominent theories of ageing. The chapter provides a summary of evidence for how to improve the physical healthcare of people with mental health problems. It discusses seven healthy lifestyle options. There is a box summarising the outcomes of some of the major cohort studies. The author hopes that readers pick up some tips for their own successful ageing as well as that of their patients.

Considering that aging can significantly affect the brain's intrinsic connectivity, identifying aging's impact on these regions' overall connection strength is important to differentiate changes associated with healthy aging from neurodegenerative disorders. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a carefully selected cohort of 175 healthy volunteers aging from 21 to 86 years old, we computed an intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) metric, which quantifies a region's overall connectivity strength, for whole brain, short-range, and long-range connections and examined age-related changes of this metric over the adult lifespan. We have identified a limited number of hub regions with ICC values that showed significant negative relationship with age. These include the medial precentral/midcingulate gyri and insula with both their short-range and long-range (and thus whole-brain) ICC values negatively associated with age, and the angular, middle frontal, and posterior cingulate gyri with their long-range ICC values mainly involved. Seed-based connectivity analyses further confirmed that these regions are connector hubs with connectivity profile that strongly overlapped with multiple large-scale brain networks. General cognitive performance was not associated with these hubs' ICC values. These findings suggest that even healthy aging could negatively impact the efficiency of regions critical for facilitating information transfer among different functional brain networks. The extent of the regions involved, however, was limited.

Initial models precluded successful ageing in the presence of chronic disease/functional disability; however, this is discrepant with self-reported successful ageing. Indicators of social, psychological and physical health in 1,735 people aged 65-74, living in Canada, Columbia, Brazil or Albania, were analysed in the International Mobility in Ageing Study. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the change in self-rated successful ageing in relation to physical health, depression, social connectedness, resilience and site, while controlling for age, gender and income sufficiency. Sixty-five per cent of participants self-rated as ageing successfully; however, this was significantly different across sites (p < 0.0005, range 17-85%) and gender (p = 0.019). Using objective measures, 6 per cent were classified as 'successful', with significant variability amongst sites (p < 0.0005, range 0-12%). Subjective successful ageing was associated with fewer (not absence of) chronic diseases, absence of depression and less dysfunction in activities of daily living, but not with objective measures of physical dysfunction. Social connectedness and resilience also aligned with self-rated successful ageing. Traditional definitions of objective successful ageing are likely too restrictive, and thus, do not approximate self-rated successful ageing.

As the baby boom generation retires, the risks of succumbing to these stereotypes and prematurely foreclosing on the potential for continued growth and meaning making throughout the life span become real. This chapter presents a voluntary one-day, three-part workshop on optimizing psychosocial resources for retirement success. The workshop is proposed for retirement community-dwelling baby boomers. Conducted by volunteer mental health professionals, the program is designed to promote understanding of resources that impact retirement adjustment using psychoeducation and a values-based approach to wellness. Mental health professionals will be challenged with meeting the needs of the baby boomer generation, taking into consideration that their unique worldview and diversity will necessitate specialized and flexible interventions that promote healthy aging. As a strength-based career development intervention likely to counter ageist stereotypes for a growing cohort of older adults. Booming through Retirement stresses emotional and motivational resources to increase the likelihood of meaning making and living in accordance with one's values.

Despite being proposed as a potential moderator of cholinesterase inhibiting drug therapy, there is a paucity of evidence investigating the impact of cerebrovascular pathology on responsiveness to cognitive interventions. Method: The current study uses neuropsychological, neurostructural, and functional connectivity indices to characterise response to a cognitive stimulation paradigm in 25 healthy ageing and 22 MCI participants, to examine the hypothesised detrimental effects of concurrent vascular pathology. Results: In both healthy ageing and MCI, increased levels of vascular pathology limited the potential for a neuroplastic response to cognitive stimulation. In healthy ageing, participants with lower levels of vascular burden had greater functional connectivity response in the target posterior default mode network. Those with low levels of vascular pathology in the MCI cohort had increased functional connectivity of the right insula and claustrum within the salience network. Burden did not, however, predict cognitive or neuroanatomical changes. Conclusions: The current research evidences the modulatory effect of cerebrovascular pathology in interventions aimed at re-establishing network connectivity to prevent cognitive deterioration and delay the transition to the dementia stage of AD. Examination of co-occurring vascular pathology may improve precision in targeting treatment to MCI candidates who may respond optimally to such cognitive interventions.

Decreased inhibitory control has been suggested as a feature of age-related cognitive decline. In this study, we compared a Virtual Apartment Stroop Task with paper-and-pencil and computerized Stroop modalities in older adults and young adults. The primary results were (a) within groups the classic ""Stroop pattern"" found in traditional modalities (e.g., paper-and-pencil; computer automated) was observed in the Virtual Apartment Stroop Task; (b) the Virtual Apartment ""Stroop scores"" between groups were consistent with significant differences found between older adults and young adults on the paper-and-pencil and computerized Stroop tasks; and (c) individuals in the older adult cohort performed significantly more poorly on the Virtual Apartment Stroop Task than did participants in the young adult cohort.

By detecting healthy aging and in turn, poor aging, we could take action to prevent chronic diseases associated with age. We conducted a pilot study comparing results of a set of markers (peripheral blood mononuclear cell or PBMC telomere length, circulating Abeta peptides, anti-Abeta antibodies, and ApoE status) previously associated with poor aging or cognitive deterioration, and their combinations, in a cohort of ""neurologically healthy"" (both motor and cognitive) nonagenarians (n = 20) and functionally impaired, institutionalized nonagenarians (n = 38) recruited between 2014 and 2015. We recruited 58 nonagenarians (41 women, 70.7%; mean age: 92.37 years in the neurologically healthy group vs. 94.13 years in the functionally impaired group). Healthy nonagenarians had significantly higher mean PBMC telomere lengths (mean = 7, p = 0.001), this being inversely correlated with functional impairment, and lower circulating Abeta40 (total in plasma fraction or TP and free in plasma fraction or FP), Abeta42 (TP and FP) and Abeta17 (FP) levels (FP40 131.35, p = 0.004; TP40 299.10, p = 0.007; FP42 6.29, p = 0.009; TP42 22.53, p = 0.019; FP17 1.32 p = 0.001; TP17 4.47, p = 0.3), after adjusting by age. Although healthy nonagenarians had higher anti-Abeta40 antibody levels (net adsorbed signal or NAS +/- SD: 0.211 +/- 0.107), the number of participants that pass the threshold (NAS > 3) to be considered as positive did not show such a strong association. There was no association with ApoE status. Additionally, we propose a ""Composite Neurologically Healthy Aging Score"" combining TP40 and mean PBMC telomere length, the strongest correlation of measured biomarkers with neurologically healthy status in nonagenarians (AUC = 0.904).

This study tested whether religiosity provides an alternative pathway to well-being and whether the associations are moderated by age cohort and nation of residency. Design and Participants: A quota sample design was used, stratified by age group, sex, and nation of residency, to collect cross-sectional survey data of 111 older adults (age range 62-99 years, M = 77.20, SD = 8.98) and 100 young adults (age range 21-30 years, M = 24.05, SD = 2.69) from Canada and the United States.Measurements:Face-to-face interviews were conducted to administer the survey. All measures consisted of validated scales and items. Results:Multi-group path analysis confirmed that mastery and purpose in life partially mediated the association between wisdom and well-being. Religiosity offered an alternative pathway to well-being, also partially through a greater sense of mastery and purpose in life. Wisdom was statistically more strongly related to mastery among older adults, whereas the association between mastery and purpose in life was statistically stronger among young adults. The mediated pathways from wisdom and religiosity to well-being did not differ by nation of residency. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of internal strengths for subjective well-being among both young and older adults and add confidence to the generalizability of the mediated path model for North America.

Most longitudinal population-based studies on predictors of SA were carried out in developed countries. Objective: This investigation evaluated which baseline characteristics predicted successful aging in 16 years of follow-up in a southern Brazilian cohort - the Porto Alegre Longitudinal Aging study. Methods: At baseline, 345 community-dwelling healthy independent individuals aged 60 or older were assessed for medical and psychiatric conditions, memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, functioning in the community and at home, and hobbies. SA, according to Rowe and Kahn's definition, was the outcome assessed in the last evaluation at a maximum 16-year follow-up. All baseline variables were evaluated as potential predictors for the outcome SA. Results: Of the 345 individuals evaluated at baseline, 32 (9.3%) participants were classified as successful agers in the follow-up. Younger age (OR=0.926, 95%CI=0.863-0.994), female gender (OR=0.226, 95%CI=0.072-0.711) and higher MMSE (OR=1.220, 95%CI=1.031-1.444) were predictors of SA for the 16-year follow-up in a logistic regression model.

Data on 335 participants collected in mid-adulthood were analyzed. Applying Latent Profile Analysis and measures of life satisfaction and psychological well-being at ages 36, 42, and 50 and social well-being at ages 42 and 50, four longitudinal well-being profiles were extracted: high (29% of the participants), relatively high (47%), moderate (22%), and low (3%). ANCOVAs (controlling for gender and education) revealed that the participants in the high, relatively high, and moderate well-being profiles had more satisfying relationships, better labor market success, and fewer diseases at age 50 than those in the low well-being profile. Fewer inter-profile differences were observed in physical or cognitive function. Favorable profiles of mental well-being are related to SA in mid-adulthood. Future studies should investigate the causal relations between well-being and SA.

In this editorial the landscape of successful aging literature is littered with pathway - and outcome-oriented conceptualizations, making this differentiation an important issue to address. Further to the notion highlighted by Cheng is the usage (and confounding) of items surrounding successful aging. Depending on the definition of successful aging used (and possibly the availability of variables in a dataset and theoretical background of the researcher), the same item may be used as a predictor, component, or outcome of successful aging. While Cheng (rightfully) advocates for the inclusion of psychosocial components into definitions of successful aging, these items are particularly prone to this conceptual confusion. In order for models of successful aging to demonstrate real world applicability, it is imperative that these theoretical constructs are investigated in practical settings, e.g. longitudinal population-based cohort studies, and their associations with public health outcomes, e.g. health service utilization, are examined.

There is little agreement as to whether raw volumes, volume-to-ICV fractions or regional volumes from which the ICV factor has been regressed out should be used for volumetric brain imaging studies. Using multiple regional cortical and subcortical volumetric measures generated by Freesurfer (51 in total), the main aim of this study was to elucidate the implications of these adjustment approaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed from two large cohorts, the population-based PIVUS cohort (N = 406, all subjects age 75) and the Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 724). Further, we studied whether the chosen ICV normalization approach influenced the relationship between hippocampus and cognition in the three diagnostic groups of the ADNI cohort (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy individuals). The ability of raw vs. adjusted hippocampal volumes to predict diagnostic status was also assessed. In both cohorts raw volumes correlate positively with ICV, but do not scale directly proportionally with it. The correlation direction is reversed for all volume-to-ICV fractions, except the lateral and third ventricles. Most gray matter fractions are larger in females, while lateral ventricle fractions are greater in males. Residual correction effectively eliminated the correlation between the regional volumes and ICV and removed gender differences. The association between hippocampal volumes and cognition was not altered by ICV normalization. Comparing prediction of diagnostic status using the different approaches, small but significant differences were found. The choice of normalization approach should be carefully considered when designing a volumetric brain imaging study.

MSE analysis was developed to distinguish random noise from complex signals since the entropy of the former decreases with longer time scales while the latter signal maintains its entropy due to a ""self-resemblance"" across time scales. A long resting state BOLD fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan with 1000 data points was performed on five healthy young volunteers to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of entropy across multiple time scales. A shorter rs-fMRI scan with 240 data points was performed on a cohort of subjects consisting of healthy young (age 23 +/- 2 years, n = 8) and aged volunteers (age 66 +/- 3 years, n = 8) to investigate the effect of healthy aging on the entropy of rs-fMRI. The results showed that MSE of gray matter, rather than white matter, resembles closely that of f-1 noise over multiple time scales. By filtering out high frequency random fluctuations,MSE analysis is able to reveal enhanced contrast in entropy between gray and white matter, as well as between age groups at longer time scales. Our data support the use of MSE analysis as a validation metric for quantifying the complexity of rs-fMRI signals.

The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of older individuals with an intellectual disability with at least one prescription error and (2) to identify potential risk factors for these prescription errors (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frailty index, level of intellectual disability and living situation). The study population consisted of 600 older (>= 50 years) individuals with an ID using one or more drugs who were randomly selected from the study cohort of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID) Study. The medication used at the time of measurement was screened for errors by a hospital pharmacist/clinical pharmacologist and a Master's student pharmacy using consensus methodology. Participants with one or more prescription errors were compared to participants without prescription errors by multivariate logistic regression to identify potential risk factors. The prevalence of individuals with one or more prescription errors was 47.5% (285 of 600 individuals; 95% confidence interval (CI) 43- 52%). Relevant errors, defined as errors that actually do require a change of pharmacotherapy, were identified in 26.8% of the individuals (161 of 600 individuals; 95% CI 23-30%). Higher age (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.06), less severe intellectual disability (moderate: ORadj 0.48; 95% CI 0.31-0.74 and severe: ORadj 0.56; 95% CI 0.32-0.98), higher BMI (ORadj 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.08), higher frailty index (0.39-0.54: ORadj 2.4; 95% CI 1.21-4.77 and >= 0.55: ORadj 3.4; 95% CI 1.03-11.02), polypharmacy (ORadj 8.06; 95% CI 5.59-11.62) and use of medicines acting on the central nervous system (ORadj 3.34; 95% CI 2.35-4.73) were independently associated with the occurrence of prescription errors. Interventions targeted to high risk patients should be designed and implemented to improve pharmacotherapy in older individuals with an intellectual disability.

Methods: Three hundred twenty-one AD, 126 MCI, and 140 older adults with healthy cognition (HC) were evaluated using the MMSE, the MoCA, a standardized neuropsychologic battery according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-NB), and an informant-based measure of functional impairment, the Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS). Diagnostic accuracy and optimal cut-off scores were calculated for each measure, and a method for converting MoCA to MMSE scores is presented. Results: The MMSE and MoCA offer reasonably good diagnostic and classification accuracy as compared with the more detailed CERAD-NB; however, as a brief cognitive screening measure, the MoCA was more sensitive and had higher classification accuracy for differentiating MCI from HC. Complementing the MMSE or the MoCA with the DSRS significantly improved diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: The findings support recent data indicating that the MoCA is superior to the MMSE as a global assessment tool, particularly in discerning earlier stages of cognitive decline. In addition, we found that overall diagnostic accuracy improves when the MMSE or MoCA is combined with an informant-based functional measure. Finally, we provide a reliable and easy conversion of MoCA to MMSE scores. However, the need for MCI-specific measures is still needed to increase the diagnostic specificity between AD and MCI.

"ABZ3VTHN","thesis","2012","Botoseneanu, Anda","Successful aging and obesity: Social and developmental heterogeneity in trajectories of body weight from middle to older ages","","","","","","Obesity is increasingly prevalent among older adults, yet little is known about the distribution of long-term trajectories of body-weight in this age group. The three essays included in this dissertation aim to depict the trajectories of body-mass index (BMI) from middle to old age and to examine social and behavioral variations in these trajectories. Eight waves (1992-2006) of the Health and Retirement Study involving a nationally representative cohort of Americans aged 51 to 61 years at baseline were used. Changes in BMI were analyzed using alternatively hierarchical linear modeling or semiparametric mixture modeling, with adjustment for time-constant and time-varying covariates. First study finds that over 14 years, respondents followed a linearly increasing BMI trajectory. Compared with Caucasians, African-Americans had higher BMI levels, while Hispanics had similar BMI levels, but lower rates of increase over time. Higher education predicted lower BMI levels and was not associated with the rate of change. Older age-at-baseline predicted lower BMI levels and lower rates of increase. No gender differences were found. The second study shows that smoking and vigorous physical activity (user status and initiation) were associated with significantly lower BMI trajectories over time. Cessation of smoking and physical activity resulted in higher BMI trajectories over time. The weight-gaining effect of smoking cessation increased during the study period, while the strength of association between BMI trajectories and PA or alcohol use were constant. In the third study, five distinct BMI trajectories are identified, differing primarily in their intercept: normal BMI trajectory (19.9% of sample), overweight (43.8%), borderline-obese (25.4%), obese (8.9%), and morbidly-obese (2.1%). Each trajectory showed an upward trend over the study period, although the rate-ofincrease varied between trajectories. Compared with Whites, Blacks and Hispanics had greater probabilities of membership in the higher BMI trajectory groups. Females had approximately half the risk of following the overweight and obese BMI trajectories compared with males. In conclusion, significant racial/ethnic, gender and educational heterogeneity in BMI trajectories exists in older adults. Health behaviors provide beneficial modifications in BMI trajectories. Tailoring of public health and clinical interventions to trajectory group characteristics may reduce obesity-related health disparities in aging.

Recent evidence suggests that unawareness of an olfactory deficit may predict which MCI patients will subsequently meet AD criteria. However, important methodological limitations challenge this suggestion. While addressing some of the limitations of previous research, this preliminary study explores unawareness of olfactory deficits as a predictive factor of future AD among people with aMCI. Methods: Twenty-five participants with aMCI, 25 AD patients, and 22 healthy elderly participants underwent testing of olfactory identification. Subjective reports regarding perceived decline in olfactory detection and olfactory identification were also obtained. A subset of participants was reassessed 12 months later. Results: Control participants performed better than both aMCI and AD patients on olfactory identification. Almost uniformly, participants did not report decline in either olfactory detection or identification. Prediction of olfactory identification scores from subjective reports of olfactory function was poor, and awareness of olfactory decline bore no relationship to the likelihood of aMCI patients progressing to AD by the 12-month review. Conclusions: Treating awareness of olfactory function as a unitary construct can be misleading, and there is a poor relationship between subjective and objective measures of olfactory ability. Our preliminary data suggest that unawareness of olfactory decline does not improve the identification of patients with MCI who are more likely to be in the prodromal phase of AD. Replication in a larger cohort is needed to support these findings.

Higher brain iron levels are associated with male gender and presence of highly prevalent allelic variants in genes encoding for iron metabolism proteins (hemochromatosis H63D (HFE H63D) and transferrin C2 (TfC2)). In this study, we examined whether in healthy older individuals memory performance is associated with increased brain iron, and whether gender and gene variant carrier (IRON + ) vs noncarrier (IRON-) status (for HFE H63D/TfC2) modify the associations. Tissue iron deposited in ferritin molecules can be measured in vivo with magnetic resonance imaging utilizing the field-dependent relaxation rate increase (FDRI) method. FDRI was assessed in hippocampus, basal ganglia, and white matter, and IRON + vs IRON- status was determined in a cohort of 63 healthy older individuals. Three cognitive domains were assessed: verbal memory (delayed recall), working memory/attention, and processing speed. Independent of gene status, worse verbal-memory performance was associated with higher hippocampal iron in men (r = -0.50, p = 0.003) but not in women. Independent of gender, worse verbal working memory performance was associated with higher basal ganglia iron in IRON- group (r = -0.49, p = 0.005) but not in the IRON + group. Between-group interactions (p = 0.006) were noted for both of these associations. No significant associations with white matter or processing speed were observed. The results suggest that in specific subgroups of healthy older individuals, higher accumulations of iron in vulnerable gray matter regions may adversely impact memory functions and could represent a risk factor for accelerated cognitive decline. Combining genetic and MRI biomarkers may provide opportunities to design primary prevention clinical trials that target high-risk groups.

This chapter examines these findings in broader geographic settings and advanced age groups. Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study, we extend the analysis of successful ageing to the oldest-old in China. The results confirm that successful ageing of the oldest-old in China is associated with more years of education and marital status. The oldest-old with positive attitudes on life, and who both exercise more often and have better physical performance are more successful in their old age and have a higher survival rate. Analysis of the substantial heterogeneity of the elderly may lead to both meaningful policies on aging, and the promotion of a better quality of life.

The author attributes the bulk of the recent increase in lifespan to improvements in public health, such as sanitation, antibiotics, and control of conditions like high blood pressure, but he acknowledges the significance of genetics, environment, behavior, and luck. It is stated that women comprise 85 percent of centenarians, a fact that sparks speculation about biological correlates of healthy aging. Genes known to be associated with extreme old age, such as variants of apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein, are the subject of intensive research and may provide clues for future antiaging interventions. Genetic links to longevity were supported by the author's (2002) studies of 444 families, in which siblings of centenarians were found to have markedly higher relative survival probabilities at older ages and a cumulative lifelong advantage over others in their birth cohort. The author describes a ""threshold"" model that can be used to explain predispositions for exceptional longevity; in this model, centenarians exceed the liability threshold for traits that lead to life-limiting illness.

We used data from a 7-year cohort study of high-functioning older persons to explore whether the associations between serum beta-carotene level and subsequent decline of cognitive function differed by APOE 4 genotype. Methods: Baseline information on sociodemographic characteristics, serum beta-carotene level, inflammation markers, APOE genotype, and cognitive functioning measured by a 9-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) was obtained in 455 survivors. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relation between high serum beta-carotene level and risk of SPMSQ score decline in participants with or without APOE 4 alleles, while adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline SPMSQ score, and other covariates. Results: Nine (2%) study participants had homozygous and 97 (21%) had heterozygous APOE 4 alleles. Two hundred forty-nine (55%) had decline of SPMSQ scores during the follow-up. The presence of an APOE 4 allele was associated with higher risk and larger magnitude of SPMSQ score decline. The adjusted odds ratio of high beta-carotene level for cognitive decline was 0.11 (95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.57) in participants with at least one APOE 4 allele and 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.54-1.47) among those who were APOE 4 negative. Conclusion: Among high-functioning older persons, antioxidants and beta-carotene in particular may offer protection from cognitive decline in persons with greater genetic susceptibility as evidenced by the presence of the APOE 4 allele.

Eight-year mortality was also examined. Results showed risk and protective effects of successful aging for physical functioning and performance, lifestyle, cognition, affect, and personality. The findings confirm that people age with differing degrees of success and those aging most successfully not only live longer but also experience a better quality of life.

This study aimed to examine the association between CVH metrics and 1) depression and 2) anxiety among young adults ages 18-34 years., Hypothesis: We hypothesized that young adults with depression or anxiety will have less optimal CVH., Methods: We used data from the Emory Healthy Aging Study (EHAS), a prospective cohort study of US adults that aims to understand factors associated with aging. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among participants ages 18-34 years who completed the EHAS Health History Questionnaire (n=882). We classified participants as having poor, intermediate, or ideal levels of the seven CVH metrics using definitions set forth by the AHA, with slight modifications as needed based on questionnaire items, and calculated total CVH scores (range 0-14). We defined depression and anxiety as absent, mild, or moderate-to-severe using standard cutoffs for Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scales. We used multivariable regression to examine the association between CVH, depression, and anxiety, controlling for gender, race, age group, income, and education., Results: A total of 134 (15.2%) participants had moderate-to-severe anxiety, and 132 (15.0%) participants had moderate-to-severe depression. The mean total CVH score among participants was 10.4. Compared to those without anxiety, participants with moderate-to-severe anxiety were less likely to meet ideal levels of physical activity (PR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.90), smoking (PR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.98), and body mass index (PR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.94). Participants with moderate-to-severe depression were less likely to meet ideal levels of cholesterol (PR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1.00), physical activity (PR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.30-0.69), smoking (PR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99), blood pressure (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98), and body mass index (PR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.93). Stratified analysis showed that these associations appeared stronger in older young adults (26-34 years). Relative to those without anxiety, participants with moderate-to-severe anxiety had a CVH score that was 0.91 points lower (standard error: 0.18, p-value<0.01). Relative to those without depression, participants with moderate-to-severe depression had a CVH score that was 1.19 points lower (standard error: 0.18, p-value<0.01)., Conclusion: Anxiety and depression are associated with CVH in young adults.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common comorbidity in HIV and has been linked to increased neurocognitive impairment in the general population. We investigated the association between MetS and neurocognition among persons living with HIV (PLHIV)., Methods: Participants included 109 PLHIV and 92 HIV-uninfected adults (HIV-) from the Multi-dimensional Successful Aging cohort study at the University of California San Diego (age: M = 50.8, SD = 8.0). Participants completed neuromedical, psychiatric, and neurocognitive assessments. Based on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery, we examined global neurocognitive deficits (based on the entire battery) and neurocognitive deficits in 7 domains (verbal fluency, learning, recall, executive function, working memory, speed of information processing, and fine motor skills). MetS was determined via the standard criteria by the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel-III. Covariates examined included demographics and psychiatric comorbidities (and HIV disease characteristics among PLHIV)., Results: MetS had an independent significant effect on global neurocognitive deficits among PLHIV (P = 0.03) but not among their HIV- counterparts (P = 0.93). Among PLHIV, MetS was most strongly associated with the neurocognitive domains of learning, fine motor skills, and executive function. Diabetes and elevated triglycerides were the MetS components most strongly linked with increased global neurocognitive deficits in PLHIV., Conclusions: The present findings underscore the need for early identification of PLHIV at risk for MetS and the implementation of preventive and treatment approaches to lessen the development of MetS and neurocognitive impairment among PLHIV., Copyright (C) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Sleep and melatonin have been associated with healthy aging. In this study, we examine the association between melatonin levels and sleep among older men., Methods. Cross-sectional study of a community-dwelling cohort of 2,821 men aged 65 years or older recruited from six U.S. centers. First morning void urine samples were collected to measure melatonin's major urinary metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). We also assessed objective and subjective sleep parameters. We used logistic regression models to calculate multivariate (MV) odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important demographic variables and comorbidities., Results. In the overall sample, the only significant finding in fully adjusted models was that aMT6s levels were inversely associated with subjectively measured daytime sleepiness (sleepiness mean score of 5.79 in the top aMT6s quartile, and 6.26 in the bottom aMT6s quartile, MV OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.95-1.84; ptrend <= .02). When restricting to men without [beta]-blocker use (a known melatonin suppressant), aMT6s levels were significantly associated with shorter sleep time, that is, less than 5 hours (MV OR, = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.21-2.99; ptrend = .01), and worse sleep efficiency, that is, less than 70% (MV OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.28-2.65; ptrend < .001). aMT6s were not associated with subjective sleep quality or respiratory disturbance in any of our analyses., Conclusion.

It is postulated that this represents preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluated the relationship between Abeta burden as assessed by PiB PET and cognitive decline in a well-characterized, non-demented, elderly cohort. PiB PET studies and cognitive tests were performed on 34 elderly participants (age 73 +/- 6) from the longitudinal Melbourne Healthy Aging Study (MHAS). Subjects were classified as being cognitively 'stable' or 'declining' by an independent behavioural neurologist based on clinical assessment and serial word-list recall scores from the preceding 6-10 years. Decline was calculated from the slope of the word-list recall scores. Abeta burden was quantified using Standardized Uptake Value normalized to cerebellar cortex. Ten subjects were clinically classified as declining. At the time of the PET scans, three of the declining subjects had mild cognitive impairment, one had AD, and six were declining but remained within the normal range for age on cognitive tests. Declining subjects were much more likely to show cortical PiB binding than stable subjects (70% vs. 17%, respectively). Neocortical Abeta burden correlated with word-list recall slopes (r = -0.78) and memory function (r = -0.85) in the declining group. No correlations were observed in the stable group. Abeta burden correlated with incident memory impairment and the rate of memory decline in the non-demented ageing population. These observations suggest that neither memory decline nor Abeta deposition are part of normal ageing and likely represent preclinical AD. Further longitudinal observations are required to confirm this hypothesis.

However, scarce information is available on the relation between 25(OH)D levels and cognitive performance over time in older individuals. Our purpose was to evaluate, longitudinally, the association of 25(OH)D with cognitive function in a healthy older adults' cohort. Methods: Sixty-four individuals over 55 years-old with no cognitive impairment, clustered as healthy ""Poor"" and ""Good"" cognitive performers, were followed for an average of 18 months. Seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D serum levels (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) were related, longitudinally, with cognitive (memory and general/executive) composite scores. Results: Overall seasonal-adjusted median serum 25(OH)D level was of 47 nmol/l [interquartile range (IQR), 38-60 nmol/l]. A negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and the general/executive composite score was found in the ""Poor"" cognitive performers (rs = -0.52, p = 0.006), an association lost after adjusting 25(OH)D levels for the season. No effect was found in both groups between seasonal-adjusted 25(OH)D levels and the variation of both memory and general/executive composites during follow-up when adjusted for age, gender and education level. Conclusion: In this healthy older population with no cognitive impairment, lower serum levels of 25(OH)D were not longitudinally associated with poorer cognitive scores.

Variations in the pattern of left/right activity have been associated with normal brain functioning, and with neuropsychiatric diseases. Such asymmetries in brain activity evolve throughout life and are thought to decrease with aging, but clear associations with cognitive function have never been established. Herein, we assessed functional laterality during a working memory task (N-Back) in a healthy aging cohort (over 50 years old) and associated these asymmetries with performance in the test. Activity of lobule VI of the cerebellar hemisphere and angular gyrus was found to be lateralized to the right hemisphere, while the precentral gyrus presented left > right activation during this task. Interestingly, 1-Back accuracy was positively correlated with left > right superior parietal lobule activation, which was mostly due to the influence of the left hemisphere. In conclusion, although regions were mostly symmetrically activated during the N-Back task, performance in working memory in aged individuals seems to benefit from lateralized involvement of the superior parietal lobule.

The goal of applying tissue correction is to decrease the dependency of metabolite concentrations on the underlying voxel tissue composition. Tissue correction strategies have different underlying assumptions to account for different aspects of the voxel tissue fraction. The most common tissue correction is the CSF-correction that aims to account for the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction in the voxel, in which it is assumed there are no metabolites. More recently, the alpha-correction was introduced to account for the different concentrations of GABA+in gray matter and white matter. In this paper, we show that the selected tissue correction strategy can alter the interpretation of results using data from a healthy aging cohort with GABA+ measurements in a frontal and posterior voxel. In a frontal voxel, we show an age-related decline in GABA+ when either no tissue correction (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) or the CSF-correction is applied (R2 = 0.08, p < 0.01). When applying the alpha-correction to the frontal voxel data, we find no relationship between age and GABA+ (R2 = 0.02, p = 0.15). However, with the alpha-correction we still find that cognitive performance is correlated with GABA+ (R2 = 0.11, p < 0.01). These data suggest that in healthy aging, while there is normal atrophy in the frontal voxel, GABA+ in the remaining tissue is not decreasing on average. This indicates that the selection of tissue correction can significantly impact the interpretation of MRS results.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, verbal and visual memory testing, and 3T-magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were performed in 79 neurologically normal adults enrolled in a healthy aging cohort study. Retinal nerve fiber thinning and reduced total macular and macular ganglion cell volumes were each associated with smaller MTL volumes (ps < 0.04). Notably, these markers of retinal structure were not associated with primary motor cortex or basal ganglia volumes (regions relatively unaffected in AD) (ps > 0.70), or frontal, precuneus, or temporoparietal volumes (regions affected in later AD Braak staging ps > 0.20). Retinal structure was not significantly associated with verbal or visual memory consolidation performances (ps > 0.14). Retinal structure was associated with MTL volumes, but not memory performances, in otherwise neurologically normal older adults.

Using combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modalities, we hypothesized that aging-related changes in white matter integrity (i.e., fractional anisotropy) was associated with the short- or long-range functional connectivity density (FCD) in hub regions. We tested this hypothesis by using a healthy aging cohort comprised of 140 younger adults aged 20-39 years and 109 older adults aged 60-79 years. Compared with the younger group, older adults exhibited widespread reductions in white matter integrity with selective preservation in brain stem tracts and the cingulum connected to the hippocampus and cingulate cortex, whereas FCD mapping in older adults showed a reduced FCD in the visual, somatosensory, and motor functional networks and an increased FCD in the default mode network. The older adults exhibited significantly increased short- or long-range FCD in functional hubs of the precuneus, posterior, and middle cingulate, and thalamus, hippocampus, fusiform, and inferior temporal cortex. Furthermore, DTI-fMRI relationship were predominantly identified in older adults in whom short- and long-range FCD in the left precuneus was negatively correlated to structural integrity of adjacent and nonadjacent white matter tracts, respectively. We also found that long-range FCD in the left precuneus was positively correlated to cognitive function. These results support the compensatory hypothesis of neurocognitive aging theory and reveal the DTI-fMRI relationship associated with normal aging.

Subjective well-being is a major determinant of health outcomes in older people. The aim of this study was to determine which factors predicted well-being in older people living in the community as measured by their satisfaction with life. Methods: The relationship between life satisfaction, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Index (LSI-A) and physical, cognitive and demographic variables was examined in 466 older people living in the community using a stepwise regression model Results: Depression, loneliness, neuroticism, extraversion, recent participation in physical activity, age and self-reported exhaustion, were the independent predictors of life satisfaction in our elderly cohort. Conclusion: Subjective well-being, as measured by the Life Satisfaction Scale, is predicted by depression, loneliness, personality traits, recent participation in physical activity and self-reported exhaustion. The mental and emotional status of older individuals, as well as their engagement in physical activity, are as important as physical functionality when it comes to life satisfaction as a measure of well-being and successful aging.

In this chapter, we address the topic of how young, middle age, older, and oldest-old adults coped with and made meaning of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita during the storms and their aftermath. The individuals who provided the qualitative interviews upon which this chapter is based were enrolled in the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study (LHAS), a multidisciplinary study of the determinants of longevity and healthy aging. We begin this chapter by presenting three central themes to contextualize our findings. These themes include (1) crisis, in the sense of a significant, developmental turning point; (2) coping, a behavioral response to stressful events; and (3) meaning making, which pertains to an individual's unique interpretation of an event and attributions for why it happened.

Tait and Hulse conclude from their prospective cohort study that there was tentative evidence that moderate alcohol use was associated with a reduction in mental health admissions compared with abstinence. However, they do not speculate on the potential role of personality differences between the different drinking categories. Preliminary evidence from the Dublin Healthy Ageing Study has demonstrated that, when assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory, lifelong alcohol abstainers have higher levels of introversion and neuroticism compared with moderate drinkers. This may have an impact not only on measures of social stability, but also mental and physical health characteristics such as depression and hypertension. Therefore the personality types and temperaments of abstainers, and not simply their zero alcohol consumption, may account for their relatively poorer health characteristics in comparison with moderate drinkers.
